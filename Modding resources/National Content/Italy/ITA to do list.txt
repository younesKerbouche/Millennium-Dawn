TO DO LIST

STUFF TO FIX

HIGH PRIORITY

FOCUS TREE

-military focus rework #will do it myself if maurizio doesnt have the motivation

-disinformation/populist support branch with russian meddlings, ridicolous talk show, fatto quotidiano bullshit ecc

-a focus tree branch about the absolute trainwreck that is Rome and its administration

-a better way to get into the non-democratic tree
example: choice between a civil war/uprising based on armed forces and a peaceful dismantling of democratic institutions
(that requires mantaining popularity against some kind of popularity loss given by the attempt to dismantle democracy)

MAFIA

-add Casamonica clan in lazio

MISC

LOW PRIORITY

MAJOR MECHANICS PROPOSALS #probably wont follow up on this in the foreseable future, more complexity to a tree that people already find too complicated, fucking scrubs

-Member of Parliament mechanic with actual chambers n shit for a better representation of government crisis
(freboot eurpean parliament UI) (or gui if that is done in the future) #will surely wait for a gui, no more decision categories please

-flesh out more the choice to get a party in power in the focus tree 
(political campaigns in the democratic branch, coups, revolts, foreign interference whatever in the non democratic)
ideally using a system of opposing values (free market - interventionism ) (progressivness - traditionalism) ( welfare state - ancap memes )
thresholds in this value would modify the popularity of parties and the amount of popularity gained by enacting or repelling policies.
(example: italy start with the population highly favoring interventionism: enacting a privatization policy will greatly lower popularity while
a nationalization policy would increase popularity. At the same time interventionist parties would get a daily popolarity gain while free market parties a slight malus.
Focuses in the tree would be used to campaign to shift those value around, for example to get liberals in power a campaign to lower interventionism
sentiment should be made so that overtime liberal popularity would grow and eventually they could be elected and have their policies enacted actually give popularity.
On the other hand forcing them into the government through boost should still be possible, but will have them govern in a situation where
their popularity will quickly decay both passively and because of their policies being enacted.

-move policy to scripted gui / ui / decision category ui as to allow greater flexibility in handling them
(example cherry picking policies to keep when changing a government through policy change)
of course introduce mutually exclusive check in the system to prevent opposite policies to be active at the same time

-european-wide projects for military vehicles and ships (optional)(will need papinian help for that probably)

MAFIA 

-more random events for mafia
-Adapt focus tree cost to the standardized building prices and make cost scale with regional mafia strength instead of using the average for all mafia branches
-make a meme tree where mafia takes over the country (super low priority)
-pictures for the scripted mafia gui (low priority)

PARTIES

-events to change parties names and icons (let zebrone handle this political boner stuff hopefully)
-make parties in the same branch always able to form coalitions
-new focus policies about social issues in the sub ideology branches
 (not needed if the major mechanic about policies is made, can just make social stuff there
-events for parties changing name and icon
-Branches for emerging socialist+non aligned communist and lega nord+lega salvini+alleanza nazionale
-Move totalitarian communists to non democratic branch
-Make a military coup path as precursor to current non democratic branch, with option to keep coup in power as nat autocracy

FOCUS TREE

-decisions to reintroduce focus effects after policy change if relevant government is back in charge
 #this might be bypassed if the more detailed policy mechanics are actually introduced, so might not be worth to try and implement it now
-custom icons for focuses, decisions, spirits and state dynamic modifiers (can't do it myself, need a graphic wizard)
-expand the "italian federation" and "dismantle the nation" sub-branches # very low priority
-make a small tree for the new nations if italy splits # very low priority
-develop the fight against tax evasion and anti corruption measures with more focuses / mechanics (focuses most likely)
-add more interactions with Internal factions all around
-referendum events for consitutional changes (to decouple it from being simply a popularity > 50% check, maybe ability to spend PP to get other parties to agree)
-make custom game rules for different AI paths
-democratic roman path

RANDOM STUFF

-reform expectance also based on laws maybe?
-zebrone's event list #where did that go?
-more in-depth migrant stuff, either focuses or dedicated events/mechanics + salafist/terrorism stuff and integration after the encourage focus
-eventually add more income and resource options for space decisions (space tourism / moon base stuff) #space stuff to be merged into a generic system for everyone
