  #Mars Base Event Chain

  mars_colony_tt: "As time goes on, our Mars Colony may experience challenges or crises which may endanger it. However, if it successful, the rewards will be tremendous.\n"

  mars.1.t: "Mars Rover Mission"
  mars.1.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send our Rover to the mars. It has a total sum of roughly 14 sensors installed, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment. This Rover will need to be regularly moved as the Mars day lasts 1 1/5 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Mars.\n\nThe Rover itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Mars. Extraction of ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for future astronauts on the Mars, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project, we will build a depot orbiting the Mars to allow easier access to the Mars, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade. Now, however, is the time to launch."
  mars.1.o1: "Launch!"

  mars.2.t: "Mars Colony Project"
  mars.2.d: "Organizations have proposed plans for a human mission to Mars, the first step towards any colonization effort, but no person has set foot on the planet. However, landers and rovers have successfully explored the planetary surface and delivered information about conditions on the ground. Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic technologies, have been proposed, and may precede humans visiting the planet. With our first crew launched, we are ready to enter a new age in space colonisation."
  mars.2.o1: "Let the journey begin!"

  mars.3.t: "Landing system failure"
  mars.3.d: "Our crew has arrived on the red planet. However the landing system has failed, leaving the crew 75.3 kilometers from the planned base camp. It becomes a race against time when the commander reveals a hitherto closely guarded secret - he injured himself during the landing. "
  mars.3.o1: "Not a good start!"

  mars.4.t: "Vehicle failure"
  mars.4.d: "The success of the mission is at stake, because the astronauts have not yet succeeded in finding a permanent shelter that offers them protection from the radiation on the surface of Mars. To make matters worse, the transport vehicle is now damaged. Time is of the essence. Without a suitable location for the planned settlement, they would have to abort the mission prematurely."
  mars.4.o1: "Let´s hope they can make it!"

  mars.5.t: "Arrival at Base"
  mars.5.d: "Due to his injuries, the commander dies. The crew arrived at the base camp, however, there is no living module, but only a workshop module. This is actually designed for two workers and ensures their survival for three months at most. Therefore, the success of the mission depends on finding a permanent refuge from the radiation on the surface and a source of water. "

  #Lunar Outpost Event Chain
  chi_moon.1.t: "Outpost on the Moon"
  chi_moon.1.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send astronauts and equipment to live semi-permanently on the Moon. A total sum of roughly 12 astronauts will be sent there, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment, supplies, living spaces, and personal items. This outpost will need to be regularly moved as the Lunar day lasts 29 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Moon.\n\nThe base itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Moon. Extraction of lunar ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for astronauts on the Moon, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project, we will build a depot orbiting the Moon to allow easier access to the Moon, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade. Now, however, is the time to launch."
  chi_moon.1.o1: "Launch!"

  chi_moon.2.t: "Moonbase Alpha"
  chi_moon.2.d: "Our scientists and engineers have officially landed on the Moon, and are currently in the process of setting up the Moon-base. Each section is divided into \"modules,\" not quite buildings on their own, but not together as one. There is a habitation module, for rest, food module, for growing food, lab module, which is the largest with most of the scientific equipment, a maintenance module, containing all the maintenance tools to repair things if they get broken, an amenities module, since these people are here for 6 months, and working all day everyday isn't good for the mind, and quite a few solar panels.\n\nFood deliveries will be common for these first months as it takes time to grow food. Water and oxygen will be obtained through the Lunar ice. Lastly, these scientists will stay until shortly after moving to the next location in roughly 6 months time when the solar panels become defunct due to the Lunar day and night where the outpost is located lasts 6 months.\n\nMoonbase Alpha is complete."
  chi_moon.2.o1: "Science!"

  chi_moon.3.t: "Colony Progresses"
  dchi_moon.3.d: "Our scientific outpost on the Moon has had a major breakthrough. With expansion of their current solar panel network, and recent discoveries making separating water to make oxygen and hydrogen easier, they have been able to come up with enough oxygen and hydrogen to fully fuel the most recent supply rocket. This is such a necessary breakthrough which will allow the Moon itself, given enough time and investment, can become a hub for future space ventures into outer space.\n\nSpace itself is getting smaller."
  dchi_moon.3.o1: "We're good at being pioneers"

  chi_moon.4.t: "Crisis on the Moon"
  chi_moon.4.d: "Drastic measures need to be taken place immediately. For reasons currently unknown, the habitation module has ruptured and \"exploded.\"\n\nAn hour ago, all 12 scientists were doing their duties when, all of a sudden, there was a massive rupture in the habitation module.\n\nSince waves don't travel in a vacuum, most didn't realize until they physically saw what had happened.\n\nThere is an emergency fund as part of the budget, so there is no need to allocate more funds to the project, and the scientists can always sleep in the other isolated modules; however, this has spooked many, stating that a few, many, or even all of our scientists could have died, and has also lowered the morale of the scientists since they could have died. Thus, attempting to continue the outpost on the Moon will be politically costly, and a rotation of scientists may need to happen now rather than later, due to the sapping of morale.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
  chi_moon.4.o1: "Send emergency aid!"
  chi_moon.4.o2: "Abandon the project. It's not meant for us"

  chi_moon.5.t: "Colony Progresses Further"
  chi_moon.5.d: "Our Moon outpost has made another major breakthrough. They have managed to ship Hydrogen 3, a gas which seems perfect for fusion, to Earth, and scientists at home have figured out how to conduct fusion with it! Not only this, but the power generated from this fusion is near the amount used to do the reaction in the first place. This means that, with some improvements, this could result in successful fusion power! Not only does this allow immense benefits at home, along with knowledge we may be able to use in using other materials for fusion, we can use this on the Moon, allowing a permanent outpost rather than mobile outposts!\n\nAll of this is far ahead of schedule, which is a surpise, and many at NASA have been left unprepared to implement this into the current Moonbase. So, a new Moonbase is needed, in a much better spot for rapid expansion than the current location of Moonbase Alpha. It's time to start preparations on Moonbase Beta."
  chi_moon.5.o1: "Life continues on"

  chi_moon.6.t: "Another Crisis on the Moon"
  chi_moon.6.d: "More drastic measures need to be taken now. Two more modules have ruptured. This time, it's both the Food and Amenities modules.\n\nRoughly forty minutes ago, a scientist was about to enter the Food module when it suddenly exploded. The scientist is fine, and no-one but the plants were harmed. However, it was adjacent to the Amenities module, and it caused it to rupture and explode. Again, no-one was hurt.\n\nThis new occurance, however, has raised the hairs of many back home, questioning the saftey of the modules. After the previous explosion, NASA replaced the modules, ensuring that they wouldn't explode, but it seems like prolonged pressure can cause something to break much more easily than it would otherwise. NASA has already quickly responded, ordering new modules be made immediately, as well as a close inspection of all current modules (As you can't \"recall\" modules from the Moon as of this moment).\n\nWith mounting pressure at home to stop going forward with the project until all safety concerns are resolved, the continuation of the Moonbase program comes into question. In addition to the political pushback, the emergency fund has been cut in half, so NASA is requesting another $5 billion to sort out future concerns. It remains your choice to decide whether to continue."
  chi_moon.6.o1: "Send more emergency aid!"
  chi_moon.6.o2: "We can't continue doing things like this"

  chi_moon.7.t: "Moonbase Beta"
  chi_moon.7.d: "At this point, our scientists and engineers on the Moon need to move to another location on the poles. The costs for doing this are already established in the long-term budget, so we don't need to add any new funding to the project yet.\n\nWith this new moonbase, we will be able to use new discoveries we have uncovered to allow the base to be established permanently, unlike our previous moonbase.With the use of better rockets, better power generation, better ice extraction and separation, we can use this new base, at a site more suited for rapid expansion, to facilitate colonization efforts of the Moon. This is not the only good news, entreprenuers and corporations are flooding to NASA en-mass for requests to put their newly developed mining systems on the Moon. Even other space programs in other countries are now extremely interested in starting up scientific and mining outposts on the Moon, however, due to your dilligent efforts, we not only have a massive head start, but we are the only country actively attempting to colonize the Moon.\n\nThe future on our Moon is bright and American."
  chi_moon.7.o1: "Huzzah!"
