As of now, 309 people have been reported killed. This was the deadliest earthquake since the 1980 Irpinia Earthquake, and due to the terrain the city lays on, this may be just the first of a long series of new earthquakes in the region."
 italy_md.16.o1: "Quick and efficient reconstructions!"
 italy_md.17.t: "Illegal Immigration Crisis"
 italy_md.17.d: "There has been an increase in illegal immigration from Northern Africa in the last years. While it offers us a larger workforce and therefore population in our country, which is suffering from a stagnant birth rate, it also worries a part of our population that thinks that we shouldn't save them from the seas but instead send them back to their country of origin."

 italy_md.22.t: "Reform Expectance"
 italy_md.22.d: "To represent Italian political instability, one of the main features of the new content given to Italy is the \"Reform Expectance\" dynamic modifier. Parties in the ruling coalition will see their popularity rapidly deteriorate unless reforms are made. If a coalition member sees its popularity drop below half of the value it was elected with it will leave the coalition. If the coalition loses too much popularity a government crisis will be triggered that can be resolved with new elections or by trying to keep the government alive at the expense of stability."

The motorway underwent heavy modernisation, and in many cases a completely new parallel motorway was built alongside the original one and involved in most cases a complete rebuilding or replacement of the road where the alignment was retained. Now that the motorway is finally opened, going to and coming from Calabria is going to be way easier, considering that half a century ago it was considered the 'Third Island of Italy' due to the nature of the terrain."

A recurring decisions allows you to dedicate more resources to Scientific Space Exploration, which will cost a significant amount of money but will provide research speed increase and a small boost to political power. Most importantly, growing your space program will eventually unlock the capability to setup an Outpost on the Moon which, in turn, will serve as a base for asteroid mining. Asteroid mining allows you to take advantage of strategic raw resources as long as you'll be willing to sustain the pretty significant yearly financial cost required to sustain such endeavour. At the same time you will need to keep your population sufficiently satisfied by the achievment of your space program, otherwise the great expenses and efforts it requires won't be justified any longer and further operations might have to be aborted."

 italy_md.28.t: "Criminals sabotage our industries!"
 italy_md.28.d: "Earlier today we received news that our industries and infrastructures were sabotages by heavily equipped criminals. The industries were set on fire and huge explosions happened on highways. Our secret agencies discovered that the attacks are an answer from the feared leaders of the 'Mafia' who didn't take our recent actions against them lightly."

 italy_md.29.d: "Once again, an attack on our industries took place, as well as bomb attacks on buses and trains. Besides the damanged industries, an unestimated number of people died in the terror attacks in city centres. Once again, all these attacks are connected with organized criminality. When will this ever stop?"
 italy_md.29.o1: "We really need to step back"
 italy_md.29.o2: "This won't stop us!"
 italy_md.30.t: "Mafia"
 italy_md.30.d: "Organized criminality is a significant problem in Italy. In the game this is represented with the new Mafia mechanics. All 4 southern states have a major \"Clan\" associated to them: Cosa Nostra in Sicily, Camorra in Campania, Ndrangheta in Calabria and Sacra Corona Unita in Puglia. Each clan has a strength value that directly reduces growth in the region in which they operate by reducing construction speed and increasing costs and time of foreign investments. Furthermore an average value of all strengths is used to calculate how much Mafia affects the country as a whole through the Mafia national spirit and by increasing focus tree expenditures cost. Industrial focuses now not only have a higher cost based on the current value of mafia influence, but will also increase mafia strength according to how much money criminals are able to siphon off the projects. To fight criminals Italy must employ its police forces and ensure italians collaborate in the eradication of Mafia. Mafia strength increases passively over time, but this increase can be lowered, and even reversed, by taking some national focuses. Furthermore effectivness of decisions to fight mafia will be based on the Police Effectivness value. That value is influenced by some focuses, Corruption, Police funding, regional Mafia strength and the amount of undercover agents in the region. Once average mafia strength has been negligible for some years a victory over Mafia can be finally declared."

 italy_md.31.t: "Weekly Stability"
 italy_md.31.d: "Many focuses and mechanics in this rework are based on weekly stability. Since vanilla HOI4 has a hard cap on how much that modifier can influence stability, a national spirit has been introduced to ensure the values are applied correctly indefinitely. Most of the choices in the tree will be between an option that grants big immediate benefits in term of stability, with an over time decrease, and an option that will instead lower your stability immediately but increase it gradually over time."

 italy_md.33.d: "Once again the new Italian regime seeks to take advantage of the church's vast influence over Italians. In exchange of our support they'll guarantee our safety and independence, what should we respond?"

 italy_md.38.o2: "Try to reach the legal end of the legislature."
 italy_md.39.t: "Policy Changes"
 italy_md.39.d: "The main mechanic of the new ideology branch is policy change. There are 10 democratic and 6 undemocratic possible choices in the ideology tree, but internal issues, such as reform expectance, or external pressure, such as being influenced, might cause the country to change its course after having already made a choice. In this eventuality the policy change mechanic will unlock the possibility of making a new change in the political direction of the country, removing all the policies of the previous government and unlocking all previous unselected choices. Campaigning to give large advantage to a party (choosing the path of that party), will increase the Reform Expectance of the population, so remember to enact the policies promised, or the government might fall sooner than you expect."
