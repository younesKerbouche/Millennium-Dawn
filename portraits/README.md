# Generic Portraits

Millennium Dawn uses generic portraits from all over the world of real people. This includes semi-famous people, politicians from smaller towns, and more. This is in no way, shape, or form a slight against anything, but rather a way to have more accurate people be in charge of nations.

## Important Information

When defining additional portraits such as new generic portraits for anything that is not a politician, you need to define a spriteType in [interface/MD_portraits.gfx](../interface/MD_portraits.gfx) for whatever type of character.

All portraits must be 156x210 pixels.
