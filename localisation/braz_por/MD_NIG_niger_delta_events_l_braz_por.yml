 nigeria_delta.1.t: "The Rise of MEND"
 nigeria_delta.1.d: "In the creeks and swamps of the Niger Delta, a new threat to Nigeria's oil industry has emerged. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, known as MEND, has formed from a coalition of militant groups including the NDPVF and various ethnic militias. Led by a shadowy figure known only as 'Jomo Gbomo', MEND has declared war on foreign oil companies and the Nigerian government, demanding greater control of oil revenues for local communities and an end to environmental devastation caused by decades of extraction.\n\nTheir first major action - the kidnapping of four foreign oil workers - has sent shockwaves through the international energy sector. Nigeria's position as Africa's largest oil producer is now under direct threat. How shall we respond to this growing insurgency?"
 nigeria_delta.1.a: "Deploy the military to crush the militants."
 nigeria_delta.1.b: "Open negotiations with militant leaders."
 nigeria_delta.1.c: "Monitor the situation for now."
 nigeria_delta.2.t: "Oil Platform Under Attack"
 nigeria_delta.2.d: "MEND militants have launched a devastating attack on a major oil platform operated by Shell in the Niger Delta. Armed speedboats swarmed the facility at dawn, overwhelming security forces and forcing the evacuation of foreign workers. The damage to critical infrastructure will significantly impact oil production in the region.\n\nInternational oil companies are threatening to withdraw operations entirely if security cannot be guaranteed. We must decide how to respond to this escalating crisis."
 nigeria_delta.2.a: "Increase security at all oil facilities."
 nigeria_delta.2.b: "Let the oil companies handle their own security."
 nigeria_delta.3.t: "Foreign Workers Kidnapped"
 nigeria_delta.3.d: "MEND has kidnapped several foreign oil workers from a Chevron facility in the Niger Delta. The militant group is demanding the release of imprisoned members and a substantial ransom payment. International pressure is mounting for the safe return of the hostages.\n\nThe families of the kidnapped workers are pleading for their safe release. The eyes of the world are upon us - how we handle this situation will define Nigeria's reputation on the international stage."
 nigeria_delta.3.a: "Pay the ransom to secure their release."
 nigeria_delta.3.b: "Launch a military rescue operation."
 nigeria_delta.3.c: "Attempt to negotiate their release."
 nigeria_delta.4.t: "Major Pipeline Sabotaged"
 nigeria_delta.4.d: "Militants have detonated explosives along a major oil pipeline in the Niger Delta, causing a massive fire and significant environmental damage. The Trans-Niger Pipeline, which carries crude oil from the delta to export terminals, has been severely damaged.\n\nOil production has been halted in the affected area, and cleanup operations will take months. The environmental impact on local fishing communities has been catastrophic, potentially driving more recruits into the arms of the militants."
 nigeria_delta.4.a: "Deploy military forces to protect remaining pipelines."
 nigeria_delta.4.b: "Focus on repairs and defer military action."
 nigeria_delta.5.t: "International Pressure Mounts"
 nigeria_delta.5.d: "The United States and United Kingdom have expressed serious concerns about the deteriorating security situation in the Niger Delta. Both nations have significant investments in Nigerian oil and are threatening diplomatic consequences if the crisis is not resolved.\n\nThey have offered financial and technical assistance to help address the insurgency, but accepting this help would mean allowing greater foreign influence in our internal affairs. On the other hand, going it alone may prove costly and ineffective."
 nigeria_delta.5.a: "Accept international assistance."
 nigeria_delta.5.b: "Handle this crisis ourselves."
 nigeria_delta.10.t: "The Amnesty Proposal"
 nigeria_delta.10.d: "After years of conflict that has reduced Nigeria's oil production by a third, the government is considering a bold new approach: offering blanket amnesty to Niger Delta militants in exchange for disarmament. The proposal, backed by President Yar'Adua, would provide rehabilitation, training, and monthly stipends to former fighters.\n\nCritics argue that rewarding armed insurrection sets a dangerous precedent, while supporters contend that the military approach has failed and dialogue is the only path to lasting peace. An estimated 26,000 militants could be affected by this decision."
 nigeria_delta.10.a: "Offer blanket amnesty to all militants."
 nigeria_delta.10.b: "Offer conditional amnesty with strict terms."
 nigeria_delta.10.c: "Continue military operations instead."
 nigeria_delta.11.t: "The Amnesty Program: Results"
 nigeria_delta.11.d: "The Presidential Amnesty Program has reached its conclusion. Thousands of former militants have surrendered their weapons and entered the rehabilitation program. The creeks of the Niger Delta are quieter now than they have been in years.\n\nThe success of this program will be judged not just by the number of weapons collected, but by whether lasting peace can be maintained in the region. The underlying grievances - environmental devastation, poverty, and lack of development - remain largely unaddressed."
 nigeria_delta.11.a: "The amnesty has succeeded - peace returns to the Delta."
 nigeria_delta.11.b: "Partial success - but challenges remain."
 nigeria_delta.11.c: "The amnesty has failed - violence will return."
 nigeria_delta.12.t: "Amnesty Program Collapses"
 nigeria_delta.12.d: "The Presidential Amnesty Program has collapsed. Former militants complain that promised payments have not materialized, training programs are inadequate, and corruption has siphoned off funds intended for rehabilitation. Many have returned to their former ways, and a new generation of fighters is emerging in the creeks.\n\nThe fragile peace won through negotiation has shattered. We must prepare for renewed conflict in the Niger Delta."
 nigeria_delta.12.a: "Prepare for the worst."
 nigeria_delta.20.t: "The Niger Delta Avengers"
 nigeria_delta.20.d: "A new militant group has emerged in the Niger Delta. Calling themselves the 'Niger Delta Avengers', they have begun a systematic campaign of sabotage against oil infrastructure that exceeds even MEND's previous attacks. Their sophisticated operations suggest connections to former MEND commanders.\n\nThe Avengers claim that the government has broken its promises to the Niger Delta people, and that only force can compel change. Nigeria's oil production is again under threat from this new insurgency."
 nigeria_delta.20.a: "Deploy the Joint Task Force immediately."
 nigeria_delta.20.b: "Attempt to open dialogue with the Avengers."
 nigeria_delta.21.t: "State of Emergency in the Niger Delta"
 nigeria_delta.21.d: "The security situation in the Niger Delta has deteriorated to the point where normal governance is impossible. Militants control large areas of the region, oil production has collapsed, and violence is spreading.\n\nThe military is requesting emergency powers to deal with the crisis. A state of emergency would allow for curfews, mass arrests, and military operations without civilian oversight. This may be the only way to restore order - or it may push the region further into chaos."
 nigeria_delta.21.a: "Declare a state of emergency."
 nigeria_delta.21.b: "Maintain normal operations."
 nigeria_delta.30.t: "Peace in the Niger Delta"
 nigeria_delta.30.d: "After years of conflict, negotiation, and careful reform, the Niger Delta crisis has finally been resolved. Oil production has returned to full capacity, and the region is experiencing unprecedented development. Former militants have been successfully reintegrated into society, and local communities are finally seeing the benefits of Nigeria's oil wealth.\n\nThe scars of the conflict remain, but the future looks brighter than it has in decades. The Niger Delta stands as a testament to what can be achieved when grievances are addressed and all stakeholders work together for peace."
 nigeria_delta.30.a: "A new chapter begins for the Niger Delta."

 nigeria_delta.101.d: "The Nigerian government has announced a Presidential Amnesty Program offering blanket amnesty to Niger Delta militants in exchange for disarmament. Observers are watching closely to see if this bold gamble will bring peace to the troubled region."

 nigeria_delta.102.t: "Niger Delta Avengers Strike"
 nigeria_delta.102.d: "A new militant group calling themselves the 'Niger Delta Avengers' has launched attacks on Nigerian oil infrastructure. Production has been significantly impacted as the government scrambles to respond to this new threat."
