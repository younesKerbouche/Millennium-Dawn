 SOV_yabloko_desc: "Yabloko, one of the oldest liberal parties in modern Russia, has finally risen to power, buoyed by a renewed wave of support for Western-style democracy. The party has become a political home for reformists—ranging from seasoned democrats of the 1990s to a new generation inspired by the promise of a liberal, just society. Their goal is nothing less than reshaping Russia into a model Western liberal democracy."
 SOV_yavlinskiy: "Grigory Yavlinskiy"
 SOV_yavlinskiy_desc: "Grigory Yavlinsky was born on April 10, 1952, in Lviv, but his political career took root in Moscow’s Soviet-era government institutions. A trained economist, he was once tasked with crafting market reforms for the USSR, but his proposals were eventually discarded in favor of other strategies. Despite setbacks, he remained a vocal advocate for reform and has led the Yabloko party from the early 1990s to the present day. His enduring presence in Russian politics reflects his commitment to a democratic and economically liberal Russia."
 SOV_russian_liberalism: "Liberalismo Russo"
 SOV_russian_liberalism_desc: "For centuries, Russia has suffered under autocrats—from the tsars to the Soviet regime. True democracy has never had the opportunity to flourish. Now is the time to break from that legacy. By embracing Western liberal values, such as self-determination, human rights, and freedom of speech, we can guide Russia into a new era of democratic governance and civic empowerment."
 SOV_fix_eltsyn_shit: "Corrigir Erros dos Anos 90"
 SOV_fix_eltsyn_shit_desc: "The economic policies of Gaidar and Yeltsin in the 1990s led Russia down a dangerous path. Instead of a vibrant market economy, the country descended into oligarchy, with wealth and power concentrated in the hands of a few. We must now right these wrongs and prove that real capitalism can work in Russia. A transparent and competitive economy must replace the crony system that was allowed to take root."
 SOV_russian_free_speech: "Liberdade de Expressão Russa"
 SOV_russian_free_speech_desc: "Freedom of speech is a fundamental pillar of any liberal society. When people are silenced, the state grows stagnant and disconnected from its citizens. This suppression led to collapse under both the empire and the Soviet Union. To safeguard our future and prevent another cycle of decay, we must protect and promote open discourse and expression for all."
 SOV_no_repressions: "Reverter Leis Repressivas"
 SOV_no_repressions_desc: "Prior to our rise to power, the government passed laws that curtailed civil liberties and imprisoned innocent citizens. These repressive measures have no place in a liberal democracy. We must dismantle these laws and release those who were unjustly punished. This is a necessary step toward justice, reconciliation, and the restoration of public trust in government."
 SOV_depoliticize_oligarchs: "Despolitizar Oligarcas"
 SOV_depoliticize_oligarchs_desc: "The fusion of political and economic power in the 1990s gave birth to an entrenched oligarchy that has weakened our democracy. These elites treat the country like a private asset. It’s essential to break this unholy alliance and ensure that political influence rests solely with the people. Only then can we return power to its rightful place—in the hands of citizens."

 SOV_new_society: "A Grande Sociedade"
 SOV_new_society_desc: "Russia has weathered the storm of recovery. Now it is time to begin the transformation of our society. We aim to construct a liberal framework for both governance and economy, moving away from the authoritarian and collectivist values of the past. Our Great Society initiative draws inspiration from Lyndon B. Johnson’s vision, but our ambition is even broader: to fundamentally reshape Russia into a modern, forward-looking liberal democracy."
 SOV_capitalism_in_500_days: "Iniciar o Programa de 500 Dias"
 SOV_capitalism_in_500_days_desc: "The 500 Days Program was originally designed to transition the Soviet economy into a market-based system. Though shelved in favor of Gaidar's Shock Therapy, the need for such reform remains. We will revive and update the program to create a more stable and inclusive economic transformation. If implemented properly, it will lay the foundation for long-term prosperity and democratic resilience."
 SOV_lgbt_rights: "Direitos LGBT"
 SOV_lgbt_rights_desc: "A truly liberal society must respect the rights and dignity of every person, regardless of their sexual orientation. LGBT individuals deserve equal protection under the law and equal access to opportunity. Recognizing their rights is not only a moral imperative but a necessary step toward building an inclusive and modern Russia."
 SOV_kill_communists: "Destruir Simpatizantes Comunistas"
 SOV_kill_communists_desc: "Communism remains one of the greatest threats to liberal reform in Russia. Fueled by nostalgia for a flawed past, its supporters seek to reverse our progress. We must decisively dismantle their networks and prevent the reemergence of authoritarian socialism. There is no place for this ideology in a modern democratic state."
 SOV_kill_revanchism: "Destruir Pensamentos Revanchistas"
 SOV_kill_revanchism_desc: "What breeds totalitarianism and illiberal ideologies? Revanchism. It festers in weak systems, waiting for a chance to resurface. Like a lingering virus, it must be eradicated if we want to secure our liberal future. We must confront it head-on—with education, reform, and strong institutions—to ensure it does not infect our society again."

 SOV_kill_fascists: "Acalmar a Onda Nacionalista"
 SOV_kill_fascists_desc: "Nationalism, when taken to extremes, poses a grave danger to a liberal, multiethnic society. History has shown the devastating consequences of nationalist regimes.

Instead, we propose a broad coalition of civil organizations and political parties—a platform for constructive debate, innovation, and oversight. Through this People's Front, we will strengthen democracy while maintaining political stability."

 SOV_preserve_working_system_desc: "Some argue that the only way to achieve a fair federal system is by granting maximum autonomy to the regions or by completely overhauling the current structure. We believe otherwise. The current federal system, though discredited by past authoritarian regimes, is fundamentally sound. Through thoughtful and democratic reforms, we can unlock its full potential and ensure it works for all Russians."
 SOV_more_fair_taxation: "Impostos Justos"
 SOV_more_fair_taxation_desc: "A critical flaw in our current system lies in regional taxation. At present, taxes are collected locally, sent to the federal government, and then redistributed—often unfairly. This system concentrates wealth in key regions while leaving others underdeveloped. We must reform the process to allow regions to control a fair share of their own resources. This will foster balanced development and reduce economic inequality and separatist sentiment."
 SOV_equal_regions: "Igualdade de Regiões"
 SOV_equal_regions_desc: "There is no need to dismantle or radically alter our federal structure. What we need is a renewed commitment to democratic governance and equal opportunity for all regions. By addressing past misuse and undertaking comprehensive reforms, we can create a system where every region, regardless of size or wealth, has a voice and the tools to prosper."

 SOV_what_we_dreamt_about_desc: "We have achieved what the original architects of Russian federalism only envisioned. Our system is now functional, democratic, and fair.

 SOV_new_form_of_the_gov_desc: "Decades of authoritarian control have eroded the democratic principles that once guided our government. The executive branch has grown unchecked in power. It is our duty to reassess and rebalance the roles of central government bodies. Only by re-establishing democratic checks and balances can we create a government that truly serves the people."
 SOV_empower_duma: "Fortalecer a Assembleia Federal"
 SOV_empower_duma_desc: "While the President's powers may seem limited on paper, in practice, they allow for manipulation of all branches of government. To preserve democracy, we must amend the constitution to limit presidential authority. We will either make the office ceremonial or eliminate it entirely, transferring true legislative power to the Federal Assembly."
 SOV_mixed_system: "O Sistema Misto"
 SOV_mixed_system_desc: "Russia’s current semi-presidential system is rooted in liberal Western principles, particularly those enshrined in the 1993 Constitution. Critics claim it fosters dictatorship, but with the right amendments, we can enhance checks and balances without a complete overhaul. By refining the system, we will prevent the concentration of power while preserving institutional continuity."
 SOV_all_powers_to_the_presidents: "Todos os Poderes para o Presidente"
 SOV_all_powers_to_the_presidents_desc: "Many believe Russia operates as a de facto presidential republic, with the President holding most practical authority. This model can still function within a democracy if restructured carefully. We will adjust the constitution to make the President the formal head of the executive branch, absorbing the duties of the Prime Minister and streamlining governance."
 SOV_changes_in_the_constitution: "Constituição Verdadeiramente Democrática"
 SOV_changes_in_the_constitution_desc: "After extensive deliberation, we are ready to implement a new wave of constitutional amendments.

 SOV_a_just_russia: "Rússia Justa"
 SOV_a_just_russia_desc: "Just Russia was founded in 2006-2007 through the merger of several left-wing political parties. Initially, many believed it was a project controlled by the presidential administration designed to simulate political competition. However, these assumptions were proven wrong when Just Russia won a significant majority in the elections, surprising many and reshaping the political landscape. The party’s rise reflects genuine popular support and a desire for social justice."
 SOV_direction: "Direção do Partido"
 SOV_direction_desc: "After coming to power, the question of our party’s direction became urgent. While we share many core values, two main factions have emerged: supporters of the liberal 'White-Stripe' movement and advocates of social patriotism. These differing visions will be debated at the upcoming party congress, which will ultimately decide our future path. This decision will shape the policies and priorities of our party moving forward."

This decision signals a commitment to openness, transparency, and cooperation with democratic nations."
 SOV_russian_democracy: "Russian Social Democracy"
 SOV_russian_democracy_desc: "The pursuit of justice and social reform has long been a defining passion of the Russian people. Throughout history, Russians have gravitated toward ideas of equality, freedom, and social fairness.

Now in power, we have a responsibility to fulfill these hopes and translate them into real social progress and democracy."
 SOV_democratisation: "Reduzir Dependência do Centro Federal"
 SOV_democratisation_desc: "Social reformists have consistently championed federalism and decentralization as key to a fair and functional Russia. To achieve balanced development across the country, it is essential to reduce regional reliance on the federal center. By empowering local governments with more autonomy and resources, we will promote equality and more responsive governance throughout all regions."
 SOV_real_welfare: "A Real Social Welfare"
 SOV_real_welfare_desc: "Reforming the welfare system is a top priority for our government. For too long, ordinary people have suffered due to failed market reforms and inadequate social insurance programs. We are committed to overhauling social security to better protect vulnerable citizens and improve their quality of life. Our goal is a system that truly supports the needs of the many, not just the privileged few."
 SOV_empower_legislature: "Inheritor of the Russian Constituent Assembly"
 SOV_empower_legislature_desc: "The Russian Constituent Assembly was the first truly representative body intended to shape the country’s future. Though it was cut short by the Bolsheviks, its legacy inspired the creation of the State Duma as the people's parliament. Unfortunately, the Duma has since lost much of its credibility and influence. It is time to restore faith in this institution by granting it real powers and ensuring genuine popular representation."
 SOV_defend_people: "Defender Nosso Povo"
 SOV_defend_people_desc: "It pains us to see single mothers struggling to afford medicine for their children or large families burdened by high-interest loans for small apartments. Poverty is spreading throughout our regions while banks and corporations grow wealthier. To combat this injustice, we must build a system of social benefits and guarantees that shield our citizens from destitution. Every person deserves dignity and protection."
 SOV_social_gurantees: "Social Guarantees and Healthcare"
 SOV_social_gurantees_desc: "Russia’s social security system faces two major challenges: pension provision and a faltering healthcare network.

 SOV_a_just_system_desc: "Our vision is a society where every individual matters, where basic human rights are respected, and political participation is encouraged.

This is the just system envisioned by the revolutionaries of the past — a society built on equality, freedom, and true democracy."
 SOV_a_just_economy: "Uma Economia Justa"
 SOV_a_just_economy_desc: "Our greatest ambition is not only a prosperous economy but a prosperous nation. Everyone should have financial security and social protection; no one should be left behind. To build such a society, wealth must be fairly distributed, with higher taxes on excessive profits and relief for the less fortunate. This approach will foster equality and social justice, laying the foundation for a stronger, more unified country."
 SOV_question_of_direction: "Questão de Direção"
 SOV_question_of_direction_desc: "The question of our party’s future direction has become increasingly urgent. Some argue that our social reforms have not gone far enough, pushing for radical changes that transform the social order entirely.

The choice before us will define our identity and influence the nation’s future path."
 SOV_revive_spirit_of_socialist_revolutionaries: "Reviver o Espírito dos Revolucionários Socialistas"
 SOV_revive_spirit_of_socialist_revolutionaries_desc: "The Socialist-Revolutionaries aimed to radically transform Russian society through agrarian socialism, believing peasants were the revolution’s driving force. While Just Russia does not claim direct succession, our reforms have sparked a peaceful but profound societal transformation, echoing the spirit of these historic revolutionaries. Though their ideas are centuries old, they remain relevant today, inspiring us to consider officially reestablishing the Socialist-Revolutionary Party."
 SOV_land_socialisation: "Socialização da Terra"
 SOV_land_socialisation_desc: "A central tenet of the Socialist-Revolutionary program was the socialization of land, meaning land would belong collectively to all Russians. This concept effectively means transferring land ownership to the state, but managed fairly for the benefit of the people. As representatives of the people, we commit to using this land equitably to maximize public welfare and agricultural productivity."

 SOV_social_democracy_sr_desc: "Social democracy remains one of the most successful political ideas to emerge from Europe.

By adopting these principles, we can implement effective reforms that promote social justice and prosperity for all Russians."
 SOV_third_way: "A Terceira Via"
 SOV_third_way_desc: "Democratic governance requires constant negotiation and balance. Many social democratic countries have shifted from traditional leftist policies toward market-oriented but socially responsible approaches known as the 'Third Way.' This philosophy combines free-market practices with social welfare goals, creating a balanced system suited to our current needs. Embracing the Third Way will help us build a modern, efficient, and fair economy."
 SOV_centre_holds: "O Centro Permanece Forte"
 SOV_centre_holds_desc: "The party’s Central Council agenda prevailed at the congress, adopting a patriotic program focused on strengthening Russia’s sovereignty, central government authority, and national unity.

It reflects a commitment to stability, power, and national pride."
 SOV_russian_patriotism: "Patriotismo Social Russo"
 SOV_russian_patriotism_desc: "Our core ideology centers on social patriotism, which emphasizes the creation of a strong, sovereign social state. This state must defend the interests of its citizens both internationally and domestically. It is the government's duty to provide conditions that ensure a high standard of living, while citizens in turn owe loyalty to their motherland by obeying laws, fulfilling compulsory service, and preserving national traditions. This balance between rights and responsibilities is the foundation of our vision for a prosperous Russia."
 SOV_empower_nation: "Empoderar o Povo Russo"
 SOV_empower_nation_desc: "We define the Russian nation not solely by ethnicity but as all the peoples inhabiting Russia's vast territories. This includes the Volga region, Siberia, and the Caucasus, whose peoples share Russian language, culture, and values. This multinational Russian nation should be prioritized by the state, representing their collective interests. Foreigners should not claim special privileges—Russia belongs to its diverse Russian nation alone, united and strong."
 SOV_talks_with_rodina: "Conversas com Rodina"
 SOV_talks_with_rodina_desc: "Our relationship with the Rodina faction runs deep, having once been a single party in the early 2000s. Internal conflicts fractured the movement, leading to the formation of Just Russia from some former Rodina members. Now, with political differences softened and programs closely aligned, it is logical to reestablish relations and work toward uniting. Such unity will enhance our ability to implement shared policies effectively."
 SOV_form_national_patriotic_front: "Formar Frente Nacional Patriótica"
 SOV_form_national_patriotic_front_desc: "Although the Russian people are strong individually, we are vulnerable when divided.

 SOV_do_not_forget_about_people_desc: "The people are the true source of power in our country, and we must always keep their needs in mind.

Our policies must prioritize improving the lives of all citizens to secure Russia’s future."
 SOV_more_regulations: "Nationalization of Corporations"
 SOV_more_regulations_desc: "For too long, capitalists have exploited both our people and our state, accumulating wealth without contributing to society. Liberal laws have enabled unchecked capitalist excess, with profits flowing only to a select few. To change this, we will nationalize major industries and establish state corporations to control the market direction. This will allow us to harness economic power for the benefit of all citizens."
 SOV_economical_platform: "Prioritize Economic Platform"
 SOV_economical_platform_desc: "For our people to prosper and for Russia to flourish, a strong economy is indispensable. No civilization can thrive without economic power and growth.

Restoring Russia’s economic might is the foundation for lasting prosperity."

 SOV_invest_in_beneficial_sectors_desc: "Reviving the country’s productive capacity requires significant capital investments. Therefore, we must channel funds into key sectors of the economy that promise sustainable long-term returns.

 SOV_rapid_militarisation: "Militarização Rápida"
 SOV_rapid_militarisation_desc: "A strong, sovereign state demands a powerful military. We will accelerate militarization by integrating military training into schools and organizing mandatory civic military activities. Defense spending will increase to ensure the army can repel any invasion. The Russian state and people must be prepared and united to defend their homeland against all threats."
 SOV_under_a_leader: "Sob um Líder Forte"
 SOV_under_a_leader_desc: "Russian statehood has historically centered around strong leaders—figures like Ivan the Terrible, Alexander III, and Joseph Stalin have commanded deep respect and shaped the nation’s destiny.

Their inclusion will strengthen our coalition and secure them representation in the government."
 SOV_unite_patriotic_parties: "Unir Partidos Patrióticos"
 SOV_unite_patriotic_parties_desc: "The breakup of the Rodina party led to many small parties sharing patriotic ideals but lacking influence on their own. Although individually weak, the political experience of their leaders can be invaluable when united under a common cause.
