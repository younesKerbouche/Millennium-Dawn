 Kurdistan.1.t: "Referendo de Independência do Curdistão"
 Kurdistan.1.d: "O Curdistão desfruta de certo grau de autonomia no Iraque desde a deposição de Saddam Hussein. No entanto, desde a invasão do Iraque, o país tem sido dominado principalmente por vários grupos xiitas, o que fez com que muitos curdos (que são majoritariamente sunitas) se sentissem excluídos.\n\nA ascensão do ISIS permitiu que o Curdistão aumentasse sua influência. Após o colapso do Exército iraquiano em 2014, que deixou o norte do Iraque sob controle do ISIS, os curdos rapidamente reivindicaram territórios do ISIS, incluindo Kirkuk, a capital cultural do Iraque.\n\nDevido ao declínio do poder do ISIS, finalmente temos a oportunidade de realizar um referendo de independência para o Curdistão"
 Kurdistan.1.a: "Realizar o referendo."
 Kurdistan.1.b: "Deveríamos nos reunir com o Iraque."
 Kurdistan.2.t: "Curdistão deseja se unir ao Iraque"
 Kurdistan.2.d: "Uma vez que a ameaça do ISIS desapareceu, o Governo Regional do Curdistão expressou a sua vontade de apoiar o governo federal do Iraque"
 Kurdistan.2.a: "Bem-vindo de volta ao lar!"
 Kurdistan.3.t: "Resultados do referendo"
 Kurdistan.3.d: "O Referendo de Independência foi realizado na região autônoma curda, bem como nas áreas que assumimos o controle durante a luta contra o ISIS. O referendo foi um grande sucesso, com 93% dos votos a favor do \"Sim\", com uma participação eleitoral de 72%. A votação aumentou significativamente a legitimidade do nosso governo para negociar maior autonomia, ou mesmo independência total."
 Kurdistan.3.a: "Lute pela independência total."
 Kurdistan.3.b: "Use isso como alavanca para autonomia."
 Kurdistan.4.t: "Curdistão exige independência"
 Kurdistan.4.d: "Devido ao sucesso do Referendo de Independência Curdo, o governo curdo está tentando usar o referendo como alavanca para declarar independência total. Parece que eles não estão satisfeitos com a autonomia limitada, e ainda mantêm Kirku, que é legitimamente parte do Iraque."
 Kurdistan.4.a: "De jeito nenhum!"
 Kurdistan.4.b: "Sim, se nos devolverem Kirkuk."
 Kurdistan.4.c: "Aceite as exigências deles."
 Kurdistan.5.t: "Curdistão exige mais autonomia"
 Kurdistan.5.d: "Devido ao sucesso do Referendo de Independência Curdo, o governo curdo está tentando usar o referendo como alavanca para exigir mais autonomia do controle do Governo Federal. Parece que eles não estão satisfeitos com apenas uma autonomia limitada, e ainda mantêm Kirkuk, que é legitimamente parte do Iraque."
 Kurdistan.5.a: "De jeito nenhum!"
 Kurdistan.5.b: "Sim, se nos devolverem Kirkuk."
 Kurdistan.5.c: "Aceite as exigências deles."

 Kurdistan.6.a: "Viva!"
 Kurdistan.7.t: "Iraque exige Kirkuk"
 Kurdistan.7.d: "Em resposta às nossas exigências, o governo iraquiano declarou que concordará com elas, mas em troca quer que devolvamos o controle da cidade de Kirkuk, que eles consideram sua por direito."
 Kurdistan.7.a: "Um preço adequado."
 Kurdistan.7.b: "Kirkuk é terra curda!"
 Kurdistan.8.t: "Curdistão recusa"

 Kurdistan.8.a: "Damn"
 Kurdistan.9.t: "Future of Kurdistan"
 Kurdistan.9.d: "Now that the negotiations with Iraq have broken down, we need to determine a path for our nation. We could start pursuing full independence, which will most likely upset Iraq. On the other hand, we bury our ideas of independence and return to be governed by the Iraqi Federal Government."
 Kurdistan.9.a: "Kurdistan is a free nation!"
 Kurdistan.9.b: "Beg for forgiveness."
 Kurdistan.10.t: "Kurdistan Declares Independence"
 Kurdistan.10.d: "The Kurdish government announced today that Kurdistan is an independent country, and not part of Iraq. This is a serious blowback to the Iraqi nation, and the Kurdish forces still control the vital city of Kirkuk. Some politicans and generals are arguing that a show of force is necessary. We need to order our troops to occupy Kirkuk, and show the Kurds our willingness to defend Iraqi lands"
 Kurdistan.10.a: "Prepare an attack on Kirkuk!"
 Kurdistan.10.b: "We don't want to start a war."
 Kurdistan.11.t: "Iraq Moves Against Kirkuk!"
 Kurdistan.11.d: "After we declared independence, we've received reports that Iraqi forces are readying for an attack against Kirkuk. Defending against well equipped and combat-experienced Iraqi troops will be difficult, and losing the battle will be a loss of face for us. On the other hand, a possible victory might scare the Iraqis off. We could also just retreat from the city to avoid bloodshed."
 Kurdistan.11.a: "Make a stand!"
 Kurdistan.11.b: "Retreat!"
 Kurdistan.13.t: "Fate of Kurdistan"
 Kurdistan.13.d: "Now that we have taken control of Kirkuk, the Kurds have no choice but to submit to us, or face even worse consequences"

 Kurdistan.14.t: "Iraq Demands Submission"
 Kurdistan.14.d: "After the defeat and loss of Kirkuk, the Iraqi government has gotten more air under its wings. They are now demanding that we abandon our future plans and submit back under their rule"

 Kurdistan.14.b: "Resist."
 Kurdistan.15.t: "Kurdistan Submits"
 Kurdistan.15.d: "Kurdistan has agreed to rejoin us!"
 Kurdistan.15.a: "Great"
 Kurdistan.16.t: "Kurdistan Resists"
 Kurdistan.16.d: "Kurdistan has refused our demands of subjugation"
 Kurdistan.16.a: "I guess we'll do this the hard way then."
 Kurdistan.17.t: "Failure at Kirkuk"
 Kurdistan.17.d: "Losing the Battle of Kirkuk was a disgrace. The Kurds still control the city, and we are humiliated. Should we still try to pursue unification?"
 Kurdistan.17.a: "We'll try again, this time bigger."
 Kurdistan.17.b: "Leave the Kurds alone."
 Kurdistan.18.t: "KDP Demands Re-Unification Talks"
 Kurdistan.18.d: "The KDP Government, led by [KUR.GetLeader], has demanded that we come to the negotiating table and join the Kurdish Unity Government. They are claiming that this is something we should have done years ago following the ending of hostilities between our two governments, but now they seem more persistent than ever before to have us join their new government. Whether we do, or do not is up to us. But if we do not, then we risk the start of renewed conflict with the KDP."
 Kurdistan.18.a: "We shall unify, for the good of Kurdistan"
 Kurdistan.18.b: "Never"
 Kurdistan.19.t: "PUK Refuses Re-Unification Talks"
 Kurdistan.19.d: "It appears that the PUK government has refused to join our United Government, and as a result, they leave us no choice but to unify the Kurdish people under one banner."
 Kurdistan.19.a: "Unfortunate that it had to come to this"
 Kurdistan.20.t: "PUK Agrees To Re-Unification Talks"
 Kurdistan.20.d: "The PUK has agreed to join our Unity Government, and negotiations are under way now to integrate their territories and troops into the new government."
 Kurdistan.20.a: "Great"
 KurdistanNews.1.t: "Kurdistan Rejoins Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.1.d: "During the apex of ISIS, Kurdistan started slowly shifting away from Iraq and becoming more independent. Now that ISIS has been defeated, the Kurdistan Regional Government seems to have made a full turn and expressed wishes to start working again together with the Iraqi federal government. Many speculated that the Kurds would be aiming for independence, but it seems they've decided to decide otherwise, possibly fearing repercussions from their neighbours."
 KurdistanNews.1.a: "Interesting"
 KurdistanNews.2.t: "The Kurdish Independence Referendum"
 KurdistanNews.2.d: "The Kurdish Regional Government has announced that it will be holding an independence referendum in the areas that they currently control. The move has been seen as controversial, given that the referendum is being held in areas that aren't officially part of the Kurdish Autonomous Region but the Federal State of Iraq, including the major city of Kirkuk.\n\nMany see this as nothing more than a land-grab by the Kurds, while others argue that the Kurds have earned their right to independence after effectively saving Iraq from ISIS. Even though the KRG claims that the results will be non-binding, many fear that it will lead to full independence and possibly a new conflict in Iraq."
 KurdistanNews.2.a: "They have no right to do this!"
 KurdistanNews.2.b: "Let's see how this play out."

 KurdistanNews.5.d: "As the negotiations between Iraq and Kurdistan broke down, Iraqi forces moved to capture the city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds had captured from ISIS earlier. As the Iraqi forces approached Kirkuk, most elements of the Peshmerga retreated from the city without a fight. Some independent elements of the Kurdish forces stayed and tried to set up a defence of the city, but were quickly overwhelmed by the Iraqis. In just two days, the Iraqi forces had regained full control of the city, most of it without any fighting."

Fearing encirclement, the Kurdish forces started retreating from the city, some under orders and some on their own. After a few days of fighting, Iraq was fully in control of the city."

 KurdistanNews.7.t: "Kurdistan Defends Kirkuk"
 KurdistanNews.7.d: "As the negotiations between Iraq and Kurdistan broke down, Iraqi forces moved to capture the city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds had captured from ISIS earlier. As the Iraqi forces approached the city, Kurdish forces took up defensive positions, with main defenses being at the K1 military base and the Kirkuk-Takrit Road.\n\nIraqi 9th Armoured Division split their forces in two, as they attacked both the military base and the city itself through its Southern suburbs. At the same time, the Popular Mobilisation Forces attacked in the centre towards Kirkuk Airfield. As the 9th Armoured Division got bogged down in the suburbs, the Kurdish forces managed to conduct a flanking attack against the PMF forces, forcing them to retreat. With the centre destroyed, the separated elements of the 9th Armoured Division were soon forced to retreat as well. The Battle of Kirkuk proved to be disastrous for the Iraqi forces, while the morale of the Kurds was greatly boosted."

 KurdistanNews.11.d: "The defeat at Kirkuk was a massive humiliation to Iraq. It seems that the defeat completely demotivated Iraq from any hostility towards the Kurds. The Kurds have won their demands through blood."
