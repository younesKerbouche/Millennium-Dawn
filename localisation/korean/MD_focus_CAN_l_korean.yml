 canada_md_politics.20.d: "오타와는 현재 단독 범인이 정부를 공격하려 시도한 사건으로 인해 봉쇄 상태에 있습니다. 사건은 그가 국가전쟁기념비에서 근무 중이던 네이선 치릴로 하사를 치명적으로 부상시키면서 시작되었습니다. 이후 그는 국회의사당으로 이동해 평화탑 아래에 위치한 센터 블록의 정문을 통해 진입했습니다. 당시 많은 국회의원들이 회의를 진행 중이었으며, 범인이 지나쳐간 방들에 모여 있었습니다. 스티븐 하퍼 총리도 그 방들 중 한 곳에 있었으며, 동료 당원들이 국기를 걸어둔 막대를 잡고 자신을 방어하려는 동안 옷장 안에 숨어야 했습니다. 범인은 복도를 지나며 몇 발의 총을 쏘았고, 그중 한 발이 신민주당(NDP) 의원들이 모여 있던 방으로 날아들었습니다. 결국, RCMP(캐나다 왕립기마경찰)가 범인을 기둥 뒤에 몰아넣었습니다. 그 과정에서 의회 경위인 케빈 비커스는 총을 쏘며 범인 옆으로 몸을 던졌고, 커티스 배럿 경관이 치명적인 총격을 가한 것으로 전해졌습니다. 이미 전 세계의 뉴스 방송국들은 이 사건을 도시가 포위된 것처럼 과장하며 보도하기 시작했습니다. 비교적 차분한 기자들조차 의회 언덕의 보안이 부족했던 점을 문제 삼고 있습니다. 아마도 미국이 자신들이 겪은 테러 공격 이후 감시를 대폭 강화했던 것이 옳았을지도 모른다는 의견이 제기되고 있습니다."

 canada_md_politics.21.d: "The Liberals have just won an election with the promise of ending our airstrikes on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. What they want to do instead is put more effort into training our allies on the ground to build a more effective fighting force. One reason for this move is that it will save costs, as we have already spent hundreds of millions on our combat operations. Another is that Canadians would not have to put their lives at risk if local forces were able to handle their own battles. There is some merit to both these arguments, but we risk upsetting our NATO allies. Other nations might get the impression that we are making them do all the heavy lifting."

 canada_md_politics.22.d: "오마르 카디르는 캐나다에서 매우 논쟁적인 인물이 되었습니다. 그의 아버지는 그를 어릴 때 아프가니스탄으로 데려갔으며, 그는 전쟁 중 알카에다와 다른 테러 단체들의 편에서 싸우게 되었습니다. 그는 미군과의 전투에서 부상을 입었고, 그 과정에서 크리스토퍼 스피어 일등병을 수류탄으로 살해했다고 전해집니다. 이후 그는 포로로 잡혀 관타나모 수용소로 보내졌으며, 그곳에서 미국과 캐나다 정보 요원들에게 심문을 받았습니다. 2010년, 그는 8년 간의 구금 끝에 전쟁 범죄 혐의를 인정했습니다. 이후 캐나다로 돌아와 남은 형기를 복역했습니다. 관타나모에서의 그의 처우를 두고 논란이 일었습니다. UN은 그가 제2차 세계대전 이후 미성년자로서 전쟁 범죄로 기소된 첫 사례라고 밝혔습니다. 전국의 시민권 운동가들은 캐나다 정보기관의 행동에 대해 강한 비판을 제기했으며, 캐나다 대법원은 그의 인권이 침해되었다고 판결했습니다. 카디르는 2015년에 보석으로 석방되었지만, 당시 보수당 정부는 이 결정을 항소하려 했습니다. 새로운 자유당 정부는 이제 이 항소를 철회할지 여부를 고려 중입니다. 어떤 결정이 내려지더라도 캐나다인들의 반응은 분명 엇갈릴 것입니다."

 canada_md_politics.23.d: "항공우주 산업이 타격을 입고 있으며 이로 인해 Bombardier는 절박한 조치를 취하게 되었습니다. 최신 여객기인 CSeries는 잠재적으로 부를 가져다 줄 수 있는 시장의 틈새 시장을 메우고 있습니다. 그러나 이러한 제트기를 구매하는 회사는 많지 않습니다. 이에 대응하여 Bombardier는 각 유정의 가격을 생산 비용보다 낮게 인하하여 더욱 매력적으로 만들었습니다. 생산 비용은 3,300만 달러임에도 불구하고 각 제트기는 1,900만 달러에 판매되고 있습니다. Boeing은 MAX 7에 대한 경쟁이 치열했기 때문에 이 점을 조금 좋아하지 않았습니다. 따라서 그들은 Bombardier를 상대로 청원서를 제출했습니다. Bombardier가 미국 정부로부터 막대한 세금 감면을 받았음에도 불구하고 Bombardier가 불공정한 경제적 이익을 누리고 있다고 비난하는 것은 다소 위선적입니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 이는 우리 항공우주 산업에 치명적인 타격이 될 수 있습니다. 현 미국 행정부가 우리가 무역 관계를 이용하고 있다고 비난해 온 것은 도움이 되지 않습니다. 다행히도 유럽이 우리를 도왔습니다. Airbus는 캐나다에 독점적인 혜택을 제공하는 대가로 CSeries 프로그램의 대다수 지분을 인수하기를 원합니다. 유럽인들은 신뢰할 수 있는 동맹국이지만, 우리가 제안을 받아들인다면 우리는 이 업계에서 그다지 독립적이지 못할 것입니다."

 canada_md_politics.25.d: "Our military and allies in NATO have been persistently asking our administration to spend more on security. They make a good argument too. Our military has been struggling to keep up with the times these past few decades. Hardware is outdated, and recruitment is on the decline. We have also been deploying our forces to an increasing number of conflict zones overseas. Our sovereignty in the north will also need to be protected as the ice continues to melt. Defense minister Harjit Sajjan has put forward a new defense policy to tackle these concerns. It calls for an overhaul of the military over the next 20 years, and this includes a 73% increase to spending over the next decade. This plan will be costly, and it is unclear where all the resources necessary will come from."

Shows are being put on, national parks are free to access, and commemorative coins have been minted. We also have a giant duck swimming around Lake Ontario. Some of our friends across the world have sent gifts too. The Dutch have bred a tulip that looks just like the Maple Leaf flag. Despite all this, not everyone is excited today. Some are criticizing the high cost of the festivities, and they would rather see the money put elsewhere. Indigineous groups assert that the sesquicentennial only reinforces hundreds of years of colonial rule. Both these points have caused a bit of tension among Canadians."
