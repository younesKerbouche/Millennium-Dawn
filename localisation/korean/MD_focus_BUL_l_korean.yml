 BUL_generic_political_effort: "불가리아의 정치"
 BUL_generic_political_effort_desc: "2000년, 불가리아의 정치 지형은 보수당인 민주세력동맹(UDF)이 야당인 불가리아 사회당(BSP)에 패배하면서 극적인 변화를 겪었습니다. 이는 UDF의 8년 집권이 끝나고 BSP의 집권이 시작되었음을 의미했습니다. 새로운 정부는 경제 개혁을 최우선으로 삼고, 국가의 재정 안정을 개선하고 외국인 투자를 유치하는 데 초점을 맞췄습니다. 초기에는 대중의 승인을 받았지만, 개혁은 느리고 논란이 많았습니다."
 BUL_steady: "침로 유지"
 BUL_steady_desc: "불가리아는 1989년 공산주의 붕괴 이후 많은 성과를 이루었으며, 그 중 하나는 민주 정부 수립입니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 최근에는 더 권위주의적인 정부로 돌아가야 한다는 논의가 있었습니다. 그러나 불가리아가 진정으로 경제 성장과 국민의 자유를 받아들이기 위해서는 민주주의를 계속 유지해야 하는 여러 가지 이유가 있습니다."
 BUL_generic_extra_tech_slot: "민영화 증가"
 BUL_generic_extra_tech_slot_desc: "불가리아의 경제는 공산주의 붕괴 이후 성장에 어려움을 겪었으며, 정부는 경제 성장을 증대시키기 위한 방법을 모색해왔습니다. 한 가지 가능한 해결책은 국가 내 재산의 민영화를 증가시키는 것입니다. 민영화는 잠재적으로 효율성을 증가시킬 수 있습니다. 민간 기업은 더 많은 이익을 추구하고 비용 절감을 유도하는 경향이 있기 때문입니다. 이는 외국인 투자를 유치하고 일자리를 창출할 수 있습니다. 또한, 민영화를 늘리면 정부는 더 이상 재산을 유지하고 관리할 필요가 없으므로 재정 부담을 줄일 수 있습니다."
 BUL_generic_extra_tech_slot_3: "의료 개혁"
 BUL_generic_extra_tech_slot_3_desc: "불가리아는 새천년의 시대에접어들면서 의료 개혁에 대한 긴급한 필요성이 있었습니다. 국가의 의료 시스템은 구식이고 부족했으며, 많은 병원들이 필요한 장비와 인력을 갖추지 못했습니다. 환자들은 종종 긴 대기 시간과 불충분한 치료를 경험하며, 이로 인해 시스템에 대한 불만과 불만족이 커졌습니다. 우리는 시스템을 개혁하고 국민의 복지를 향상시킬 필요가 있습니다."
 BUL_nato_joining: "NATO 가입"
 BUL_nato_joining_desc: "불가리아의 잠재적인 NATO 가입은 상당한 논쟁의 주제입니다. 한편, NATO에 가입하면 불가리아는 잠재적인 외부 위협에 대한 안보 보장과 보호를 받을 수 있습니다. 또한 군사 훈련 및 지원, 정보 공유, 고급 기술 등 NATO의 광범위한 자원에 접근할 수 있습니다. 또한 NATO 회원국은 불가리아의 국제사회에서의 지위와 위상을 강화할 것입니다."
 BUL_fighting_immigration: "반대파 탄압"
 BUL_fighting_immigration_desc: "결국, 불가리아 정부의 조치는 야당을 효과적으로 침묵시키고 앞으로 수년간 집권당의 권력을 공고히 할 것입니다. 비록 그 나라가 더 큰 민주주의와 표현의 자유를 향해 진전했지만, 정치적 혼란의 사건들은 그 이익들이 얼마나 쉽게 되돌릴 수 있는지 뚜렷한 경고로 남아 있어야 합니다."
 BUL_elitism_question: "엘리트주의 질문"

 BUL_sheghen_question: "국경 합의"
 BUL_sheghen_question_desc: "불가리아는 유럽 연합(EU)와 국경 규제 및 경찰 협력에 관한 중요한 협약을 체결해야 합니다. 이러한 협약은 국가의 EU 가입을 촉진하는 데 필수적이었습니다. 불가리아는 지역의 평화, 안전, 안정을 보장하는 데 있어 효과적인 국경 통제 및 관리의 중요성을 인식했습니다. 그 결과, 국가의 국경 관리 역량을 강화하기 위한 종합 계획이 개발되고 실행되었습니다. 여기에는 감시 장치를 개선하고, 인프라를 업그레이드하고, 국경 통제 요원들을 위한 고급 훈련 프로그램을 제공하는 것이 포함되었습니다."

If Bulgaria allows US troops to be deployed on its land, it will help ensure security in the region. The presence of US troops in Bulgaria will serve as a deterrent for any potential threat or aggression towards the country. It will also contribute to enhancing the collective security of NATO, of which Bulgaria wants to be a member of."

 BUL_novo_selo_desc: "Bulgaria, a country located in the Balkan region of Europe, should seriously consider opening the US Novo Selo and Graf Ignatievo military airbases. There are plenty of reasons to support this decision. Firstly, by opening these airbases, Bulgaria will strengthen its strategic partnership with the United States. This partnership will offer Bulgaria defense and security benefits that will help protect the country from external threats."

The main objective is to modernize the public administration system and reduce bureaucracy, which had hindered economic growth and foreign investments."
 BUL_liberty_ethos: "Democratic Bulgaria"
 BUL_liberty_ethos_desc: "The year 2000 was a turning point for Bulgarian society as it faced numerous political, economic and social challenges. Despite the difficulties, there is no doubt that the democratic ethos was the best choice for the country. Democracy offers citizens the opportunity to have a say in their government and participate in decision-making processes. This creates a sense of ownership, empowering individuals to take responsibility for their collective destinies. Additionally, democratic societies place great emphasis on individual rights and freedoms, which are critical for personal and societal development."
 BUL_collectivist_ethos: "New Bulgaria, old ways"
 BUL_collectivist_ethos_desc: "The year 2000 marked the start of Bulgaria's democratic establishment. However, many people view it as the worst political leadership in the country's history. One of the primary reasons why it is deemed as such is the fact that the government failed to counter the rampant corruption that plagued the nation. Another factor that contributed to this negative perception was the lack of progress and economic growth. Instead, poverty and unemployment remained prevalent, and the living standards continued to decline. There was also a growing sense of political instability, which eroded public trust and confidence in the government."
 bulg.4.t: "Monarchist Coup in Bulgaria!"
 bulg.4.d: "Bulgaria was hit by a monarchist coup that brought back symbols of the country's former monarchy. The coup was led by a faction within the Bulgarian political leadership, who sought to bring back a constitution similar to the one present in the pre-communist era. This move was met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as an attempt to move Bulgaria towards authoritarianism, while others believed that the restoration of the monarchy would bring stability to the country's politics. The coup was successful, and the new constitution featured the monarchy as a ceremonial head of state. The Bulgarian royal family was granted a significant role in the country's political and social life, and they continue to hold a prominent position in Bulgarian society to this day. With the current government plagued by corruption and economic instability, there is a growing movement in Bulgaria dedicated to the restoration of the monarchy. Led by a group of influential politicians, military leaders and loyalists to the former royal family, this movement seeks to create a constitutional monarchy that will bring stability and prosperity to the nation."

 bulg.5.t: "Communist Revanche in Bulgaria!"
 bulg.5.d: " Bulgaria experienced a communist coup, with the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) gaining power. This was a significant political shift in the country following years of democratic reforms and liberalization. For many Bulgarians, it was a step back towards the communist regime that they had fought so hard to remove. The BSP was able to gain power through a coalition government with the Movement for Rights and Freedoms party. This coalition essentially gave the BSP control of the government, allowing them to implement policies that were reminiscent of the communist era. They implemented more state control over the economy, limiting private enterprise, and increasing government spending on social policies."

In recent times, both nations have shown a willingness to negotiate and work towards a resolution.

However, in 1996, Bulgaria suffered a severe economic crisis which was partly the result of a banking system collapse and a sharp depreciation of the national currency. By the year 2000, Bulgaria's economy was slowly recovering from the crisis, but still faced a number of challenges. The country's GDP was growing at a moderate rate, but unemployment remained high and poverty levels were significant.
