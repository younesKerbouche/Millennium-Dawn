 KAN_ideas_tribal_resistance_spirit_desc: "They have labeled us, devalued us and disregarded us for too long. The northern government of Lakota is but a fake government, only caring about their cabal of people rather than of everyone under their banner. As such we shall rise and create a true and fair government, not just for ourselves but for anyone who wishes to live a better, more free and fairer life."
