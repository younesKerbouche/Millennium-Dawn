 engine_scramjet_desc: "A scramjet (short for \"supersonic combustion ramjet\") is a type of air-breathing jet engine designed to operate at hypersonic speeds, typically between Mach 5 and Mach 15. Unlike traditional jet engines, which rely on fans and compressors to move and compress incoming air, scramjets achieve compression through the high-speed movement of the aircraft itself, using an \"air-breathing\" method to capture and compress incoming air as it enters the engine."
 engine_ramjet: "Turboramjet Engine"
 engine_ramjet_desc: "A ramjet (or \"ram-air jet engine\") is a type of air-breathing jet engine that operates by compressing incoming air through the engine's forward motion, rather than using rotating compressor blades like in a traditional jet engine. Ramjets are simple and efficient at supersonic speeds, generally from Mach 2 to Mach 6, but they cannot function at low speeds and require an initial boost to reach their operating range."
