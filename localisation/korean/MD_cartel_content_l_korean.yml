 anti_cartel_propaganda_decision: "반카르텔 선전"
 anti_cartel_propaganda_decision_desc: "There has always been a growing myth surrounding the cartels, that they are like the banditos of the rose-tinted past. Lovable rogues that may do bad things but only do them for the good of their people. Like all myths, it is a fabrication. One that anyone living under the influence of the cartels knows to be false. By exposing the horrors inflicted by them upon their own in a nation-wide media campaign, we can work towards dispelling this myth once and for all."
 police_investments_decision: "경찰력 투자"
 police_investments_decision_desc: "Criminal organizations like the cartels are sophisticated enterprises with extensive resources, financing, and weaponry. They cannot be deterred with minimal force or standard policing methods. Our police forces stand as the primary defense against these organizations, yet they frequently lack the resources to counter the extreme violence they face. While militarizing our police carries certain societal costs, providing them with enhanced equipment, advanced tactical training, and increased personnel is essential for creating an effective barrier against cartel operations. This transformation requires significant financial investment, but is necessary to establish the security foundation our nation needs to combat organized crime effectively."
 utilize_the_military_decisions: "군대 활용"
 utilize_the_military_decisions_desc: "While our police forces may be well-equipped, they remain constrained by limited manpower, local bureaucracy, and potential corruption. Deploying military forces provides us with superior firepower, a robust command structure, and extensive resources that can bypass local administrative obstacles. The military's national organization allows for coordinated operations across regions where cartels operate. However, this approach comes with significant drawbacks: civilians often fear military presence in their communities, local police may resent the implied inadequacy of their efforts, and civilian infrastructure can suffer damage during operations. Military deployment also risks human rights concerns and may undermine public trust in government institutions. We must carefully weigh the tactical advantages against the potential loss of public support and legitimacy."
 target_cartel_money_laundering_decision: "돈 세탁 작전 목표 설정"
 target_cartel_money_laundering_decision_desc: "Cartels must launder their illicit profits to acquire legitimate assets, transforming 'dirty money' through a three-stage process: placement into the financial system, layering to obscure origins, and integration into legal holdings. These laundered funds enable them to purchase property, businesses, and influence government officials. By targeting the layering and integration phases, we can disrupt their financial infrastructure and stem corruption. This involves methodical investigation and shutdown of complicit financial institutions and shell companies. However, this strategy carries significant risk—failed operations may provoke violent retaliation as cartels defend their cash flow, potentially intensifying their hostility toward government forces and civilians alike."
 investigate_the_casinos: "카지노 수사"
 investigate_the_casinos_desc: "Casinos operate in a regulatory gray area, making them ideal entry points for laundering illicit funds. Their high cash turnover creates an environment where large sums can be processed without raising suspicion, appearing both anonymous and legitimate. Our strategy will involve identifying establishments frequented by known cartel associates and conducting thorough audits of their financial operations. By meticulously tracing suspicious transactions and establishing direct links to criminal organizations, we can build airtight cases against these fronts. Once sufficient evidence is gathered, we'll execute coordinated raids to shut down these operations and seize their assets, dealing a significant blow to the cartels' financial infrastructure while recovering funds for the state."
 investigates_the_banks: "은행 수사"
 investigates_the_banks_desc: "Banks, though typically legitimate institutions, are critical conduits in sophisticated money laundering operations. Through strategic investigation of senior banking officials and financial analysts, combined with comprehensive analysis of transaction records, we can intercept suspicious fund movements before they're completed. By exercising patience and surveillance, we can strike when illicit funds reach their maximum concentration—typically as they approach their final destination. This approach inflicts maximum financial damage on criminal organizations while removing substantial capital from their operations. However, maintaining effective monitoring presents significant challenges, as criminal enterprises continuously evolve their methods to circumvent detection. Furthermore, shutting down implicated banking institutions remains politically unfeasible due to their economic importance and powerful connections."
 investigate_shell_companies: "페이퍼 컴퍼니 수사"
 investigate_shell_companies_desc: "Shell companies serve as crucial intermediaries in sophisticated money laundering operations, functioning as both midpoint and final repositories for criminal assets. These legal entities hold property and capital on behalf of cartels while gradually transferring these assets toward legitimate destinations. They present a significant investigative challenge, as establishing direct connections to criminal organizations requires extensive financial forensics and intelligence gathering. Despite this difficulty, successfully targeting shell companies can devastatingly disrupt a cartel's financial infrastructure. Rather than yielding large cash seizures, these operations typically result in the confiscation of substantial physical assets—commercial real estate, luxury vehicles, industrial equipment, and legally acquired weapons—as criminals typically move money through these fronts in smaller, consistent transactions designed to avoid detection."
 target_cartel_drug_running_decision: "마약 밀매 작전 목표 설정"
 target_cartel_drug_running_decision_desc: "Drug-running operations constitute the largest illegal revenue source for cartels. While some cartels cultivate drugs themselves, many generate profits by moving refined or unrefined products through the supply chain. By systematically targeting and monitoring these transportation routes, we can identify origin points, destinations, and transit hubs. This intelligence enables us to conduct strategic raids on equipment depots, refineries, farms, drug houses, and operational bases. Alternatively, we can intercept shipments in transit, though this approach typically proves ineffective against larger operations. However, it can significantly destabilize smaller groups with limited resources to recover from such losses."
 raid_drug_convoys_decision: "마약 운반선 기습"
 raid_drug_convoys_decision_desc: "Intercepting drug convoys in transit allows us to efficiently disrupt supply chains with minimal operational costs. While major cartels possess the resources to quickly adapt their routes and transportation methods, smaller organizations are particularly vulnerable to these operations. The sudden loss of product and revenue can devastate their financial stability, often triggering internal conflicts as leadership struggles to maintain control amid dwindling resources. These targeted interdictions provide high-visibility successes that demonstrate government action while simultaneously exploiting divisions within criminal hierarchies."
 raid_cartel_hideouts_decision: "카르텔 아지트 기습"
 raid_cartel_hideouts_decision_desc: "Targeting cartel strongholds and supply depots directly disrupts their operational infrastructure, severely limiting their capacity to transport narcotics, coordinate activities, and defend their territory. These raids typically yield significant seizures of tactical vehicles and weaponry that would otherwise be deployed against government forces or rival organizations. A strategic consequence of these operations is the potential destabilization of cartel power dynamics—weakened organizations often become targets for territorial expansion by competitors, which can either fragment criminal networks to our advantage or trigger escalated violence as power vacuums emerge."
 raid_distribution_centres_decision: "물류 센터 기습"
 raid_distribution_centres_decision_desc: "Targeting cartel distribution centers—including drug houses and stockpiles—allows us to intercept substantial quantities of narcotics before they reach the streets. These operations yield significant seizures of illicit cash and result in the arrest of key distribution personnel, disrupting the supply chain for weeks or months. However, these raids carry heightened risk of violent retaliation, as they directly impact cartel profits while leaving their enforcement capabilities intact. Intelligence gathering before such operations is critical, as distribution centers are typically well-guarded and strategically positioned to facilitate quick dispersal of products and personnel."
 raid_refinement_centres_decision: "정제 센터 습격"
 raid_refinement_centres_decision_desc: "마약 실험실, 재배지 또는 재배하우스를 습격함으로써, 우리는 카르텔이 새로운 마약을 생산하여 유통하는 능력을 방해하고, 그들을 크게 후퇴시킬 수 있습니다. 이 후퇴는 보통 몇 달 동안 마약 생산을 방해할 만큼 충분히 큰 손실을 입히며, 카르텔이 손실을 만회하려고 시도하는 동안 생산에 큰 영향을 미칩니다. 동시에, 대부분의 카르텔 자원이 자국 영토를 보호하는 데 사용되기 때문에 보복 공격이 일어날 가능성은 낮습니다."
 target_local_cartel_leaders_decision: "지역 카르텔 지도자들 목표 설정"
 target_local_cartel_leaders_decision_desc: "Cartels, like any sophisticated organization, rely on a hierarchical leadership structure to coordinate their operations. By strategically targeting and neutralizing local cartel leaders—whether through arrests or more permanent means—we can severely disrupt their command chain. This destabilization produces multiple benefits: recruitment efforts falter without proper direction, operational capacity diminishes significantly, and internal power struggles erupt as subordinates compete for vacant leadership positions. Additionally, these high-profile captures or eliminations generate substantial positive media coverage, boosting public morale and demonstrating the government's effectiveness in combating organized crime. Each successful operation against these figures not only weakens the cartel's infrastructure but also erodes their perceived invincibility."

 cartel_event.33.t: "Suspicious Transfers tied to Oligarch"
 cartel_event.33.d: "During one of our recent investigations, we uncovered suspicious, albeit not illegal, money transfers from a certain oligarch's fund within our nation. It would be easy to grease the political gears to implicate them in our recent investigation. However, such an overreach would no doubt anger both foreign and domestic oligarchs."

 cartel_event.36.t: "Cartel Tank Used in Strike"
 cartel_event.36.d: "최근의 급습 이후, 카르텔이 우리 경찰서 중 하나를 대상으로 보복 공격을 감행했습니다. 그들은 최근 목격된 T-34를 이용해 울타리를 부수고 건물 내부를 향해 무차별 사격을 가하며 건물을 파괴했습니다. 이 사건으로 인해 상당한 사상자가 발생했으며, 사건은 전국적으로 보도되었습니다."

 cartel_event.37.d: "최근 압류한 회사들 중 하나의 자산을 평가하는 과정에서, 다수의 전 군용 6x6 트럭이 등록되어 있는 것이 발견되었습니다. 간단한 조사 끝에 이 차량들은 해당 회사가 소유한 창고에서 확인되었습니다. 이 차량들은 현재 농장과 다양한 산업에서 흔히 사용되고 있지만, 여전히 우리 군에서 일부 구식 역할에 사용되고 있기도 합니다."

 cartel_event.40.t: "Anonymous Tip Off"
 cartel_event.40.d: "We've received an anonymous tip about a vulnerable cartel outpost. If we act quickly, we could overrun the position. However, this could be a prank or a ploy by the cartels to move us out of position and ambush us."
 cartel_event.40.a: "Act on the tip, any opportunity is a real one!"
 cartel_event.40.b: "Ignore the tip, it's most likely a prank."
 cartel_event.41.t: "카르텔과 협력하는 지역 사업체"
 cartel_event.41.d: "Several businesses in one of our outlying towns have been exposed as working with the cartels, at times even openly. Allowing this to continue sends a clear message to our people that we are either unwilling or unable to govern. But to the cartels, it sends a message that we respect their authority to do so."

 cartel_event.42.t: "Industrial Conglomerates Safehousing Contraband"

While this may be a sign of blatant corruption, a chance exists that it was the result of blackmailing. In either case, some kind of response from us is necessary. Otherwise, the tipper is likely to go to the news."
 cartel_event.42.a: "Seizes the warehouses and fine the conglomerates!"
 cartel_event.42.b: "Seize the contraband and give businesses a slap on the wrist."

 cartel_event.46.t: "Enticing Cartel's Bribes"
 cartel_event.46.d: "Several members of our political establishment have recently been approached with an intriguing proposition. We treat the cartels like any other interest group, giving them space to operate as they please, and they bankroll several important, upcoming elections. The more ideologically malleable of our members are looking to us for guidance."
 cartel_event.46.a: "Of course! We're happy to be working with such an important interest group."
 cartel_event.46.b: "Outrageous! They do not represent the people's best interests."
 cartel_event.47.t: "Deals with the Devils"
 cartel_event.47.d: "Several high-ranking members of our political establishment were recently invited to a meeting with the heads of one of our nation's largest cartels.

While surveys indicate many plan to leave once they are capable of doing so, those who plan on staying seem intent on voting against us in the next election. We attempt an outreach program to try to channel the most energiested among them into fixing their home country with us."

 cartel_event.54.t: "Failed Cartel Retaliatory Strike"

A review of the incident has revealed that a stray bullet struck the pilot in the neck, leading to the catastropic crash as the co-pilot failed to regain control in time.

 cartel_event.50.d4: "우리의 최선의 노력에도 불구하고, 분석가들은 카르텔과 우리의 조사가 진행된 카지노 간의 연결 고리를 찾지 못했습니다. 더 나쁜 점은, 사람들이 조사에 사용된 자금의 흐름에 대해 질문을 하기 시작했고, 이로 인해 야당의 정치적 공격을 받은 우리 후보들이 성공적으로 타격을 입었습니다. 더욱 심각한 점은, 카르텔들이 여전히 방해받지 않고 그들의 작전을 계속하고 있다는 것입니다."
 cartel_event.50.t5: "실패한 은행 조사"
 cartel_event.50.d5: "수주 동안 우리 요원들이 컴퓨터 앞에 앉아 은행 이체를 모니터링하며 노력했음에도 불구하고, 카르텔에 타격을 입힐 명확한 기회를 찾지 못했습니다. 더 나쁜 점은 사람들이 조사에 사용된 자금의 흐름에 대해 질문을 하기 시작했고, 이로 인해 야당의 정치적 공격을 받은 우리 후보들이 성공적으로 타격을 입었습니다. 더욱 심각한 점은, 카르텔들이 여전히 방해받지 않고 그들의 작전을 계속하고 있다는 것입니다."
 cartel_event.50.t6: "실패한 페이퍼 컴퍼니 조사"
 cartel_event.50.d6: "조사에 투입된 시간과 돈에도 불구하고, 우리가 발견한 것은 이혼 보장 자금과 책임 보호 계획뿐입니다. 더 나쁜 점은, 그 과정에서 우리가 충분히 많은 사람들의 발을 밟아 조사가 전국 뉴스에 보도되도록 만들었다는 것입니다. 이러한 망신은 아마도 우리의 미래 선거 전망에 큰 타격을 입혔을 것입니다. 더욱 심각한 점은, 카르텔들이 여전히 방해받지 않고 그들의 작전을 계속하고 있다는 것입니다."
