 faction_manifest_containment_of_decadence_name: "Endiguer la décadence occidentale"
 faction_manifest_containment_of_decadence_desc: "'In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful'\n--------------\nWhat do we have but our own flesh and blood to protect this land? The imperialist thirst for soil which is not theirs could never be clenched with simple diplomacy. At last, an Axis of Resistance is the only way forward in preventing further imperialist agendas from gaining ground in the world, even if it means fighting to the very last man."
 faction_manifest_peace_in_our_time_name: "La paix dans le monde"
 faction_manifest_peace_in_our_time_desc: "'Animus in consulendo liber'\n--------------\nThe collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the rise of international law and order once more was all thanks to the collective effort of NATO Member States. Today, however, it appears that some states in our world have decided to exploit this era of stability for their own interests, and are actively working against NATO efforts. In order to ensure security in our times we must work to expand the alliance to new frontiers, and ensure the safety for all peoples globally."
 faction_manifest_unite_islamic_countries_name: "Unissons le monde islamique"
 faction_manifest_unite_islamic_countries_desc: "Depuis des siècles, le monde islamique est divisé ; aujourd'hui, grâce à la coopération et à la compréhension, nous pouvons être à nouveau unis."
 faction_manifest_the_second_red_wave_goal_name: "La deuxième vague rouge"
 faction_manifest_the_second_red_wave_goal_desc: "Lorsque les bolcheviks prirent le pouvoir, ils allumèrent un feu qui brûla pendant des décennies. Pourtant, ils ne purent résoudre le principal défaut de leur nouveau système : l’incompétence de ses dirigeants. Tandis que l’Occident se renforçait, l’Union soviétique stagnait. Nous avons trop longtemps vécu sous des dictatures communistes. Il est temps pour nous de gouverner le monde selon notre propre vision du communisme."
 faction_manifest_comeback_of_the_monarchy_name: "The Comeback of The Monarchy"
 faction_manifest_comeback_of_the_monarchy_desc: "For centuries, monarchies have ruled the world with wisdom and strength. Yet in recent decades, republics and democracies have taken over, introducing only temporary peace and stability. That prosperity began to fall, so it is time for the monarchies to rise again, to restore order and tradition to our nations. Through unity and cooperation, we can bring back the glory of the monarchy and lead our people to a brighter future."
 faction_manifest_preserving_our_place_name: "Preserving Our Place in the World"
 faction_manifest_preserving_our_place_desc: "'Collective security in a multipolar world'\n--------------\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union brought about the creation of several states. Such an event posed itself as an opportunity to the Western bloc, where the United States and the rest of NATO sought out to bring former Soviet states under their influence. Though many are saying that a newly hegemonic United States is the worlds sole super power, it is our factions intent to derail any hope of that becoming a permanent reality. Through strength in unity we will ensure that the post-Soviet sphere is protected, armed, and prepared."
