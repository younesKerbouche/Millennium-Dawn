 FSA_death_over_humiliation: "La mort plutôt que l'humiliation"
 FSA_death_over_humiliation_desc: "L'Armée syrienne libre est issue d'un groupe de déserteurs militaires connu sous le nom de Mouvement des officiers libres. Ces officiers ont refusé d'obéir aux ordres de réprimer les troubles civils, préférant prendre les armes contre le gouvernement qu'ils avaient servi. Leur décision a marqué le début d'un mouvement d'opposition armée plus vaste. Malgré une situation extrêmement difficile et un manque fréquent de commandement centralisé et d'approvisionnement régulier, le mouvement reste animé par la conviction que la liberté vaut plus que la vie sous la tyrannie."
 FSA_extremism1: "Low Radical Influence"
 FSA_extremism1_desc: "While the Free Syrian Army was originally formed by defected officers advocating for a democratic and secular alternative to the regime, the prolonged conflict and decentralized nature of the opposition have allowed more radical factions to gain ground. Islamist-leaning groups such as Ahrar al-Sham, Al-Nusra Front have increasingly operated alongside or within FSA-branded coalitions. These groups have blurred the lines between moderate and extremist elements as these groups use the broader FSA label to gain legitimacy and resources."

 FSA_internal_revolt_category: "Wolves in Sheep's Clothing"
 FSA_internal_revolt_category_desc: "As the conflict drags on the Free Syrian Army has become a patchwork of brigades with differing goals, loyalties, and ideologies.

While they offer experienced fighters and hold key territory, their long-term ambitions pose a direct threat to any attempt at building a democratic or pluralistic post-conflict Syria."
