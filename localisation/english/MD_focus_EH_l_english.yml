 EH_event.0.d: "Event Horizon is our first huge special scenario, made to celebrate 1 million subscribers on Steam Workshop. It's a war-focused scenario, where humanity is fighting for its survival against unknown alien invaders. The scenario features a unique focus tree, new events, decisions, mechanics, units and resource that will immerse you in this epic battle for survival. Prepare to face the unknown and lead humanity to victory and thank you for your support!"
 EH_event.0.a: "Wooohooo!!! Wait, ALIENS?!!!"
 EH_event.1.t: "The Zenobia and Saladin Lines are Under Construction"
 EH_event.1.d: "In response to the growing threat emerging from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle Eastern Alliance has authorized the rapid construction of a fortified defense line along the southern Nile and western desert sectors of Egypt. Designated the Zenobia Line, this position will anchor heavy artillery emplacements, trench systems across key approach vectors.\n\nShould the Zenobia line fall, the Saladin line stands strong behind it. Spanning the entire canal zone from Port Said to the Red Sea, this fortification will act as the absolute defense line.\n"
 EH_event.1.a: "Let the desert become our shield"
 EH_event.300.t: "CERN Reaches Beyond"
 EH_event.300.d: "Researchers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) have successfully conducted a controlled high-energy collision resulting in the temporary creation of what is being described as a 'localized interdimensional anomaly.'\n\nWhile the rift was measured at the subatomic level and lasted only a fraction of a nanosecond, it marks the first recorded instance of energy signatures not consistent with known physical laws. Initial containment protocols held, and no material transfer was observed—but the implications are already sending shockwaves through the global scientific community.\n\nThe line between theoretical and real has just blurred."
 EH_event.300.a: "Is this truly safe?"
 EH_event.301.t: "UN Convoy Missing in Central Africa"
 EH_event.301.d: "A United Nations humanitarian convoy operating in the border region between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo has gone dark. Satellite imagery shows signs of wreckage and overturned vehicles scattered along a jungle route, but no distress signals were received.\n\nNo survivors or bodies were recovered. No rebel faction has claimed responsibility. The cause of the incident remains officially unknown."
 EH_event.301.a: "Another attack on UN peacekeepers..."
 EH_event.302.t: "Unusual Seismic Activity in the Tarim Basin"
 EH_event.302.d: "A cluster of shallow, high-frequency tremors has been recorded in the Tarim Basin, western China. The seismic patterns are inconsistent with natural tectonic movement or known subterranean activity. Chinese authorities have not released a statement, but regional seismology data quietly shared through a university exchange program has raised eyebrows among geophysicists."
 EH_event.302.a: "The readings don’t make sense"
 EH_event.303.t: "Radio Silence in the Pamirs"
 EH_event.303.d: "A high-altitude PLA listening post near the Chinese-Tajik border has ceased all communication. No official word has come from Beijing, but a Kazakh amateur radio operator reported hearing a brief emergency transmission in Mandarin before total silence. Intelligence satellites show visible signs of damage."
 EH_event.303.a: "Was it a Tajik attack?"
 EH_event.304.t: "Missing Rangers in Northern Alaska"
 EH_event.304.d: "Two National Park rangers patrolling a remote sector of the Denali National Park have been declared missing after failing to check in for 72 hours. A search team was dispatched, only to discover their abandoned camp with clear signs of a struggle.\n\nWhile the story was only reported by local newspapers at first, it started to gain national and international traction when the search party also vanished without traces. The FBI has now opened an investigation and a manhunt is underway."
 EH_event.304.a: "A murderer on the loose?"
 EH_event.305.t: "Strange Outbreak in the Peruvian Highlands"
 EH_event.305.d: "A remote village in the Andean highlands of southern Peru has been quarantined by regional health authorities following a mysterious outbreak. Initial reports describe fever, hallucinations, and acute sensory disorientation among locals. The symptoms emerged rapidly after a reported 'flash of light' and tremor felt only within a narrow valley near the village.\n\nPeruvian officials claim it is an isolated fungal infection, but NGOs operating nearby say medical teams have been escorted by military personnel. A geologist from the National University of San Marcos, part of a research team surveying nearby caves, is among the missing."
 EH_event.305.a: "Keep us updated"
 EH_event.306.t: "Unrest in Xinjiang: Military Base Attacked"
 EH_event.306.d: "A violent incident has occurred near Kashgar, western Xinjiang. Chinese state media is silent, but intelligence reports indicate that Base 36, a PLA facility near Yecheng, was overrun by unidentified hostile elements during the night. Description given through radio made little sense as to the real nature of the attackers.\n\nThe People’s Liberation Army has begun emergency deployment of mechanized units and chemical response teams to the region. Transport planes were seen landing at the Kashgar airport in the early hours.\n\nIn a rare move, a Russian rapid response detachment has also crossed into China through the Kulma Pass."
 EH_event.306.a: "Situation under control, according to Beijing"
 EH_event.307.t: "Tactical Nuclear Detonation in Western China"
 EH_event.307.d: "A tactical nuclear explosion was detected near the Taklamakan Desert, roughly 120 kilometers east of Kashgar. The blast occurred five days after PLA units were deployed to contain the unknown threat in the region.\n\nBoth Beijing and Moscow have denied any use of nuclear weapons, but seismic data confirms a low-yield detonation consistent with a Russian tactical warhead. Satellite images show scorched terrain, collapsed geological strata, and a rapidly expanding dark orb.\n\nInternational observers are pressing for answers, but official channels remain silent. Within military circles, speculation is growing that the strike was a unilateral decision by Russian field command under emergency engagement doctrine."
 EH_event.307.a: "What's going on there?!"
 EH_event.308.t: "The Veil is Torn"
 EH_event.308.d: "Satellite images leaked by an unnamed intelligence source have gone viral worldwide: a vast, purple, pulsing orb looming over the scorched remains of the impact site with a swarm of creatures coming out of it. Scientists are at a loss to explain the images. The footage clearly shows that the nuclear strike failed to destroy it, and if anything, only caused it to grow. Within hours, three new portals of similar size and effect erupted:\n- In Northwestern Alaska\n- In the Kenyan highlands, near Mount Elgon\n- In southern Chile, near Cape Horn.\n\nReports are already pouring in that the creatures are highly aggressive. The age of normalcy is over."
 EH_event.308.a: "The truth can no longer be denied"
 EH_event.309.t: "The UN Convenes an Emergency Assembly"
 EH_event.309.d: "With public panic mounting and confidence in national governments faltering, the United Nations has entered emergency session. The General Assembly has invoked rarely used crisis powers, and the Security Council is locked in urgent debate over coordinated response strategies.\n\nProposals range from global military cooperation to joint scientific task forces. Tensions are rising between the permanent members as blame circulates and agendas collide.\n\nBut if the early engagement reports are any indication, one truth is already clear: humanity must stand united or face extinction."
 EH_event.309.a: "A global response begins to take form"
 EH_event.310.t: "A United Command"
 EH_event.310.d: "The UN emergency assembly has concluded with the creation of the UN Joint Command (UNJC). An international body tasked with coordinating military strategy, intelligence, and logistical support against the rapidly expanding extra-dimensional threat. While primarily advisory, the Command has been granted unprecedented operational latitude.\n\nIn parallel, regional blocs like the European Union have begun floating proposals for full political and military unification, citing the need for seamless mobilization and shared sovereignty in the face of extinction. What was once unthinkable is now discussed openly in parliaments across the continent."

 EH_event.500.d: "Since the first portals tore into Earth, fragments of an unidentified metallic substance have been found around the world. Most assumed it was dimensional transformation of existing metals, strange but inert.\n\nThat changed today. Dr. Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist and one of the world’s leading minds on higher-dimensional physics, has cracked the structure and properties of the material, revealing it as a stable, lightweight, and highly resilient metal with immense potential for military applications.\n\nNow dubbed Randallite, the substance is uniquely suited for advanced alloys, combining strength, heat resistance, and flexibility. With proper refinement, it may serve as the foundation for a new generation of war machines to help us win."

 EH_event.1000.d: "The Project T.E.S.L.A. turned out to be an enormous success. [FROM.GetName] performed a successful raid to close one of the Chimera Portals, causing all Chimera forces in the huge perimeter to instantly loose consciousness. The creatures are still alive so the local population is adviced to not get into any contact with the bodies. The national army is on its way to kill Chimera units in their sleep."
 EH_event.1000.a: "Those son of a bitches did it."
 EH_focus_event.1.t: "Grand Mobilization Plan"
 EH_focus_event.1.d: "They appeared suddenly. They are attacking everything that moves, and they are not stopping until everything is dead. Our scientists are trying to figure out what those creatures are, where they come from and how to stop them. Meanwhile, our military is trying to hold the front line and protect our citizens. We have to act fast before they will reach our borders. We can rely on our professional army, or we can call for a massive mobilization."
 EH_focus_event.1.a: "Throw at them everything we have!"
 EH_focus_event.1.b: "We will rely on professional army."
 EH_focus_event.2.t: "First Generation of Chitin Soldiers"
 EH_focus_event.2.d: "Recent research on Chimera troops allowed to create a new breed of soldiers - the Chitin Soldiers. New armor will make our people more resilient to physical attacks from the aliens, and their futuristic design brings hope and excitement among the population."
 EH_focus_event.2.a: "When a fiction meets reality."
 EH_focus_event.3.t: "The Drones Reached Their Target"
 EH_focus_event.3.d: "The drones have took detailed pictures of the structure around the Portal. To further understand its purpose and functionality, except for the defence purposes, the scientists will have to analyze the gathered data. Luckily, there's a biology professor who will want to take a closer look at the photos."
 EH_focus_event.3.a: "Let's hope it was worth it."
 EH_focus_event.4.t: "Chimera Destroyed The Drone Squadron"
 EH_focus_event.4.d: "The Chimera forces have successfully intercepted and destroyed the drone squadron before it could complete its mission. No single machine managed to take any picture and send it before being shot down."
 EH_focus_event.4.a: "Another failure..."
 EH_focus_event.5.t: "Chimera Forces Destroyed The Research Site"
 EH_focus_event.5.d: "The Chimera forces have discovered and destroyed one of our Research Sites. Some of the research data was lost, but at least the Chimera didn't left without any casualties."
 EH_focus_event.5.a: "Look for the survivors!"
 EH_focus_event.6.t: "Chimera Forces Repelled From The Research Site"
 EH_focus_event.6.d: "The Chimera didn't manage to destroy our Research Site. No research data was lost, and the scientists are safe."
 EH_focus_event.6.a: "Great victory!"
 EH_focus_event.7.t: "Scientist Missing"
 EH_focus_event.7.d: "One of the scientists didn't manage to escape the Research Site before the Chimera forces attacked it. We don't know if the scientist is dead or alive, but we have to assume the worst, there's currently no way to launch a rescue mission."
 EH_focus_event.7.a: "Damn it!"
 EH_focus_event.8.t: "Portal Energy Emissions Weaken Chimera Forces"
 EH_focus_event.8.d: "Thanks to spending more time on monitoring unusual energy emissions from the Portal that has been disrupting our satellite network, our scientists have discovered that those emissions follow very specific patterns. New satellites have been equipped with special sensors that can detect these emissions and use them to interfere with Chimera communication systems. This breakthrough may significantly weaken the Chimera forces."
 EH_focus_event.8.a: "This is a great breakthrough!"
 EH_focus_event.9.t: "Private Ownerships Sends Workers To Help the Research Sites"
 EH_focus_event.9.d: "Huge private corporations have gathered together to help our scientists in their research against the Chimera. They are sending their best workers to help construct new Research Sites, speeding up the whole process significantly."
 EH_focus_event.9.a: "Great news!"
 EH_focus_event.10.t: "Military Generals Offers Additional Security For the Research Sites"
 EH_focus_event.10.d: "Our military generals have offered to send additional troops to protect our Research Sites from Chimera attacks. Their experience in combat and knowledge of Chimera tactics will be invaluable in ensuring the safety of our scientists and the success of our projects."
 EH_focus_event.10.a: "We appreciate their support!"
 EH_focus_event.11.t: "A Billionaire Shares His Money To Fund The Assets"
 EH_focus_event.11.d: "A wealthy billionaire has decided to donate a significant portion of his fortune to fund our Research Sites. This huge asset will cover the costs of building new facilities and will greatly increase research speed."
 EH_focus_event.11.a: "Cut his taxes!"
 EH_focus_event.12.t: "Randallite Vein Discovered"
 EH_focus_event.12.d: "A new vein of Randallite has been discovered by the search team. It is now our decision to set up mining operations and extract this valuable resource."

 EH_a_new_resource: "A New(?) Resource"
 EH_a_new_resource_desc: "Dr. Lisa Randall has been studying a new resource, Randallite, for quite a while already. With her scientist team, Dr. Randall discovered it's uncommon endurance while being incredibly lightweight. After discovery of the Randallite, other nations noticed decreased amount of [RESOURCE HERE]. It is possible that the Portals are transmutating it into Randallite. Maybe that's the common resource on the other side of the Portal? We need more research on that."
 EH_a_fine_addition_to_my_collection: "A Fine Addition to My Collection"

 EH_first_hacs_prototype: "First HACS Prototype"
 EH_first_hacs_prototype_desc: "Jaegers, Atlas, Evangelion and so on. Advanced combat mechs remained only a fiction until recent events changed everything. The High Agility Combat System (HACS) is a real-life operational combat mech, constructed only because of the properties of Randallite. The weight is no longer a big issue after we've started to use an alloy much stronger than steel and lighter than magnesium. With this tech we may be finally able to deal significant damage to enemy forces."
 EH_new_enemy_new_strategy: "New Enemy, New Strategy"
 EH_new_enemy_new_strategy_desc: "Stupid Problems reqiore Stupid Solutions, and this is the stupidest problem we have ever encountered. Aliens fight like someone unafraid of harm, and this is what we'll take advantage of. Heavy units armor is very protective, but not impenetrable. We have to win this fight by being faster than tanky units, and stronger than flying creatures. That said, we need more Randallite, and bullets, duh."
 EH_more_mechs_less_weapons: "More Mechs, Less Weapons"
 EH_more_mechs_less_weapons_desc: "Mechs are our only efficient weapons against those creatures. Their production takes a lot of time, and the Randallite stockpile is limited. It will be better option to convert some factories to help construct parts for the Mechs, instead of the OG weapons."
 EH_more_weapons_less_mechs: "More Weapons, Less Mechs"
 EH_more_weapons_less_mechs_desc: "Mech production takes most of our resources. If we continue this full-scale production, our economy might fall into depression and we will never recover from the debt. It is time of war, but we cannot destroy our economy for these new machines."
 EH_iron_man: "Iron Man?"
 EH_iron_man_desc: "First new mechs are already fighting on the battlefield. Now the true fight has started, where we may finally stand a chance against Invaders. Some people began to speculate, how far can we go with this technology. Of course, the Marvel fan base began sending us their blueprints of Iron Man armor... actually, why not?"

 EH_military_advantages: "Military Advantages"
 EH_military_advantages_desc: "We need to learn how Randallite will be able to help our troops. While the mechs are being constructed, we have more of this ore than we can spend on the new machines. We have to find more ways to use it."
 EH_ranjets: "Ranjets"
 EH_ranjets_desc: "Randallite has allowed us to build the first-ever combat mechs. It's so lightweight that we don't have to limit ourselves to just this new technology. This will solve many problems related to aircraft thrust and weight. Planes with lighter hulls will be able to carry more cargo and weapons, and our jets will be even more maneuverable than ever before."
 EH_not_so_heavy_weapons: "Not So Heavy Weapons"
 EH_not_so_heavy_weapons_desc: "We can use Randallite in heavy weapons production instead of steel, titanium, and other materials. The weapons will be lighter, and it will be easier for soldiers to carry and use them. Trucks will use less fuel for transportation, so everything benefits from this change."
 EH_find_new_veins: "Find New Veins"
 EH_find_new_veins_desc: "Many resource sites have been replaced with Randallite. We don't know how this process is progressing, but it may be a good time to start digging for more resources. Maybe we can find more Randallite underground."
 EH_more_precious_than_gold: "More Precious Than Gold"
 EH_more_precious_than_gold_desc: "Randallite is already everywhere. Huge companies are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on this resource. It's like a good old gold rush, but Randallite is far more useful than this resource. We can make common tools, machines and weapons and that's only a very shortened list. We, the state, have to find as much Randallite as possible before greedy businesses will put a monopoly on it's excavation, research and export. It's hard to believe we actually have to fight with our own nation, but putting restrictions may be the final consequence if the situation will get out of hand."
 EH_civilian_benefits: "Civilian Benefits"
 EH_civilian_benefits_desc: "Our war situation is stable, so we can focus on using Randallite in public spaces. If the situation with the Invaders gets worse, we can always switch to military production without many issues."
 EH_a_wonderful_prosthesis: "A Wonderful Prosthesis"
 EH_a_wonderful_prosthesis_desc: "The incredible endurance and lightweight nature of the Randallite allowed us to construct a new model of leg prosthesis, making its users even more \"healthy\" than they would be with their old leg. It is time to take synthetic extensions of the human body to a Cyberpunk-like level!"
 EH_market_potential: "Market Potential"
 EH_market_potential_desc: "There are a lot of people who want to get their hands on Randallite. Since we are no longer in a rush with military projects, we can start selling Randallite to investors and for commercial use. Big companies will start replacing their machines with ones made from Randallite, reducing the amount of fuel used around the world to power heavy machinery and vehicles."
 EH_study_new_enemy: "Study New Enemy"
 EH_study_new_enemy_desc: "After the nuclear strike on the mysterious Portal, a some sort of a new creatures began to spread in a circle around it. They are highly aggressive and they attack everything that moves. We don't know if we can stop them but if there is a way to defend against them, we have to find out how asap."
 EH_launch_orbital_scans: "Launch Orbital Scans"
 EH_launch_orbital_scans_desc: "We can use our satellites to study enemy maneuvers and learn they movement patterns, if they have any. This should help our strategists to prepare more effective traps and counter-tactics."
 EH_find_the_weak_spots: "Find The Weak Spots"
 EH_find_the_weak_spots_desc: "Those creatures can be killed. After all they are made out of blood and organic matter. If we manage to bring one of them into our laboratory, we might find their most crucial organs to study them for our advantage. As soon as we find out the critical organs, we will train our soldiers and combat systems to target them if possible."
 EH_disassemble_invader_armor: "Disassemble Invader Armor"
 EH_disassemble_invader_armor_desc: "Most of the Invaders are resistant to our weapons thanks to their hard chitin-like armor. We can begin research to learn its structure and adapt it to human body armor. Maybe this will make our troops slightly more resistant to enemy attacks."
 EH_portals_must_be_the_key: "Portals Must Be The Key"
 EH_portals_must_be_the_key_desc: "We have to gather more intel about the nearest Portal, anything that could be useful for us. They are resistant to nuclear strike but nothing is indestructible. We will find a way to close them even if it means we have to send our drones and aircraft on a suicide missions."
 EH_investigate_strange_structure: "Investigate Strange Structure"
 EH_investigate_strange_structure_desc: "We have noticed a strange behavior from our enemies. They seem to build something around the Portals, probably to secure it. If they are building some kind of fortress, we have to act fast before they'll separate them completely. Our next step is to prepare a detailed reconnaissance mission using our combat drones. The enemy is dominating the airzone so it's rather a suicide mission, but we have to hope at least one machine will manage to take any pictures of this structure and send it to our command."
 EH_finding_their_vulnerability: "Finding Their Vulnerability"
 EH_finding_their_vulnerability_desc: "With frequent enough bombardments we might find the weakness of the components this structure is built from. The most crucial things to check are heat and blast resistance, and toxic corrosion. There's no way we can check their freezing density but we can check the behavior of other materials from those monsters to see how they will react to lower temperatures."
 EH_but_how_does_this_key_work: "But How Does This Key Work?"
 EH_but_how_does_this_key_work_desc: "Those Portals lead to another dimension, that's for sure. Whether it is the Upside Down, Anti-Earth or whatever else, it should have anything that allows it to open and maintain the connection. Finding out how they are doing this may be important to understand their nature, functionality, and   perhaps, with a bit of luck   we will find a way to disrupt its work and terminate that connection."
 EH_project_tesla: "Project T.E.S.L.A."
 EH_project_tesla_desc: "Tactical Electromagnetic System of Linear Annihilation will be our greatest chance to show the monsters who's really in charge here. Once the weapon is ready, we will fire it at the nearest Portal. If our theory is correct, the electromagnetic pulse should be strong enough to interrupt the connections and, maybe, close it, temporary, or permanently."
 EH_whole_new_dawn: "Whole New Dawn"
 EH_whole_new_dawn_desc: "We know everything we should know to close the Portals. As long as we stick to the plan, we should be strong enough to finally end this war."

 # SPECIAL PROJECTS
 sp_monitor_portal_energy_emissions_project: "Monitor Portal Energy Emissions"
 sp_monitor_portal_energy_emissions_project_desc: "With the help of our satellites, we will monitor energy emissions from the nearest Portal. This will allow us to gather more intel about the enemy and their movements."
 sp_monitor_portal_energy_emissions_project_prototype: "Irregular Energy Markings"
 sp_monitor_portal_energy_emissions_project_prototype_desc: "Our damaged satellites managed to report some irregular energy markings they are constantly picking up from the Portals. It seems like they are responsible for the malfunctions in our satellite network. We can prepare countermeasures to protect our satellites from those emissions, or we can spend more time researching this phenomenon to better understand it."
 sp_monitor_portal_energy_emissions_project_prototype_a: "Progress is The Most Important"
 sp_monitor_portal_energy_emissions_project_prototype_b: "Spend Time For Additional Research"

 sp_spies_in_hive_project: "Spies in Hive"
 sp_spies_in_hive_project_desc: "Some of the Chimera units head back to their Portal zone after successful assault. They seem to have almost instinctual behavior during this phase, creating a window of opportunity to mark them with a tracker and a little camera. Aftar that, we will allow them to go back to the Portal. What could go wrong?"
 sp_spies_in_hive_project_prototype: "Mechs can be our delivery mans"
 sp_spies_in_hive_project_prototype_desc: "Since we are producing Mechs, we can use them to place trackers while fighting the Chimera forces. It will be risky and for sure we will loose many good machines and their pilots, but it can bring us closer to end this war."
 sp_spies_in_hive_project_prototype_a: "Use only Mechs"
 sp_spies_in_hive_project_prototype_b: "We can't loose too many Mechs, army will help"
 sp_spies_in_hive_project_prototype_c: "Don't take additional risk"

 sp_the_tesla_weapon_project_desc: "The Tactical Electromagnetic System of Linear Annihilation (T.E.S.L.A.) is a superweapon designed to emit a powerful electromagnetic pulse (EMP) capable of disabling electronic systems within a wide radius. This weapon could be our key to disrupting the Portals and permanently weakening the Chimera forces."
 sp_the_tesla_weapon_project_prototype: "Redirecting the research sector"
 sp_the_tesla_weapon_project_prototype_desc: "We can redirect all our research efforts towards the development of the T.E.S.L.A. weapon. This will speed up the project, but it may delay other important research initiatives."
