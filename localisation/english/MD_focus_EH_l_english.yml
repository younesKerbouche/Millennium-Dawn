 # EVENTS
 EH_focus_event.1.t: "Grand Mobilization Plan"
 EH_focus_event.1.d: "They appeared suddenly. They are attacking everything that moves, and they are not stopping until everything is dead. Our scientists are trying to figure out what those creatures are, where they come from and how to stop them. Meanwhile, our military is trying to hold the front line and protect our citizens. We have to act fast before they will reach our borders. We can rely on our professional army, or we can call for a massive mobilization."

 EH_focus_event.7.a: "Damn it!"

 # FOCUS TREE
 EH_protect_the_homeland: "Protect the Homeland!"
 EH_protect_the_homeland_desc: "We have been invaded by an unknown forces of devil itself. We have to defend ourselves with everything we have to repel the threat and survive to see another day!"
 EH_territorial_advantages: "Territorial Advantages"
 EH_territorial_advantages_desc: "Invaders are stronger in close combat... or overall combat. So, if we can't beat them with strength, we have to be smarter. New defense program will help us use landscape for our advantage and maybe it will be enough to win some battles."
 EH_cold_acclimatization: "Cold Acclimatization"
 EH_cold_acclimatization_desc: "Invaders are extremely resistant to cold temperatures. Extra problem is that two portals are located on Alaska and Tibet. If we want to have chance to get near them, we need to get stronger, or develop new ways of fighting with cold."
 EH_300: "300"
 EH_300_desc: "Narrow mountain passes are incredible difficult terrain to get through. A perfect place for an ambush if you ask me. As long as we can deal with their air support, we can use those passes to gain incredible advantage in the battles."
 EH_heat_acclimatization: "Heat Acclimatization"
 EH_heat_acclimatization_desc: "Monsters are very resistant to the forces of nature. We also need to be stronger. We have fought on this planet longer than these things and that experience should be used now for our advantage."
 EH_sandstorms_are_our_allies: "Sandstorms Are Our Allies"
 EH_sandstorms_are_our_allies_desc: "We know, when the sandstorms are coming. With such knowledge we could prepare our defense and use the sand to our advantage. Let's just hope the monsters don't have any \"biological radars\"."
 EH_observe_local_fauna: "Observe Local Fauna"
 EH_observe_local_fauna_desc: "Animals provide perfect early detection system. Those monsters are a threat to all species, and our animals seems already acknowledged of their presence. Large group of fleeing in panic animals may be an important information, when our radars go silent."
 EH_our_weakness_to_their_disadvantage: "Our Weakness to Their Disadvantage"
 EH_our_weakness_to_their_disadvantage_desc: "Plains are extremely useful for our vehicles, but tanks and IFV aren't enough to stop those monsters. But thanks to flat terrain, we will be able to prepare something special, that hopefully will give us a temporary advantage on the battlefield."
 EH_electric_traps: "Electric Traps"
 EH_electric_traps_desc: "With controlled powerful electric shocks we should be able to give our units a few minutes of spare time to attack enemy troops. The energy drain will be huge, so we will have to find a way to reduce power usage in the country, or prepare new construction sites."
 EH_transfer_energy_from_civilian_sector: "Transfer Energy From Civilian Sector"
 EH_transfer_energy_from_civilian_sector_desc: "We're draining too much power when traps are active. Charging them takes too long and we can't wait whole week to use them again. We will transfer some energy from public sector to our energy banks."
 EH_invest_in_additional_power_sources: "Invest In Additional Power Sources"
 EH_invest_in_additional_power_sources_desc: "The war cannot affect civilians even more than it already does. We will setup new reactor project to establish energetic safety for today and any other day."
 EH_reduce_energy_loss: "Reduce Energy Loss"
 EH_reduce_energy_loss_desc: "Those traps are draining too much energy. They are effective, but costly for our infrastructure. We cannot decrease their power, but we can find ways to limit power usage from other sources."
 EH_nation_remains_untouched: "Nation Remains Untouched"
 EH_nation_remains_untouched_desc: "Whatever those creatures are, we cannot just leave everything to strengthen up the military. People will continue their normal lives like nothing bad is happening..."
 EH_put_away_internal_problems: "Put Away Internal Problems"
 EH_put_away_internal_problems_desc: "Homeland protectionism is currently the most important objective. Without the army, there will be no nation to protect. People will have to deal with their problems by themselves while we are strengthening the military. If the army will fail, so the society."
 EH_minimal_military_focus: "Minimal Military Focus"
 EH_minimal_military_focus_desc: "Civilian industry is currently more important than production of new weapons. If the war is far away from us, there's no reason to spend too much money on defense."
 EH_high_military_focus: "High Military Focus"
 EH_high_military_focus_desc: "Enemy is getting closer to our capital with every day. We cannot let our guards down and we have to speed up the production."
 EH_lower_conscription: "Lower Conscription"
 EH_lower_conscription_desc: "Other nations are loosing a lot of manpower, but our soldiers mostly patrol our borders. We don't need to recruit more of them only to spend more money on the military."
 EH_extended_conscription: "Extended Conscription"
 EH_extended_conscription_desc: "Keeping enemy out of our borders is the most important task, we cannot loose any more land!"

 EH_prioritize_military_companies: "Prioritize Military Companies"
 EH_prioritize_military_companies_desc: "Research and increased weapon production should be our top priority. Without guns our men will not be able to fight with those unholy creatures."
 EH_a_new_resource: "A New(?) Resource"
 EH_a_new_resource_desc: "Dr. Lisa Randall has been studying a new resource, Randallite, for quite a while already. With her scientist team, Dr. Randall discovered it's uncommon endurance while being incredibly lightweight. After discovery of the Randallite, other nations noticed decreased amount of [RESOURCE HERE]. It is possible that the Portals are transmutating it into Randallite. Maybe that's the common resource on the other side of the Portal? We need more research on that."
 EH_a_fine_addition_to_my_collection: "A Fine Addition to My Collection"
 EH_a_fine_addition_to_my_collection_desc: "Randallite will be a great component for weapons and armor. Once we equip ourselves with Randallite, we may be able to repel not only alien creatures but also other nations."
 EH_first_hacs_prototype: "First HACS Prototype"
 EH_first_hacs_prototype_desc: "Jaegers, Atlas, Evangelion and so on. Advanced combat mechs remained only a fiction until recent events changed everything. The High Agility Combat System (HACS) is a real-life operational combat mech, constructed only because of the properties of Randallite. The weight is no longer a big issue after we've started to use an alloy much stronger than steel and lighter than magnesium. With this tech we may be finally able to deal significant damage to enemy forces."
 EH_new_enemy_new_strategy: "New Enemy, New Strategy"
 EH_new_enemy_new_strategy_desc: "Stupid Problems reqiore Stupid Solutions, and this is the stupidest problem we have ever encountered. Aliens fight like someone unafraid of harm, and this is what we'll take advantage of. Heavy units armor is very protective, but not impenetrable. We have to win this fight by being faster than tanky units, and stronger than flying creatures. That said, we need more Randallite, and bullets, duh."
 EH_more_mechs_less_weapons: "More Mechs, Less Weapons"
 EH_more_mechs_less_weapons_desc: "Mechs are our only efficient weapons against those creatures. Their production takes a lot of time, and the Randallite stockpile is limited. It will be better option to convert some factories to help construct parts for the Mechs, instead of the OG weapons."
 EH_more_weapons_less_mechs: "More Weapons, Less Mechs"
 EH_more_weapons_less_mechs_desc: "Mech production takes most of our resources. If we continue this full-scale production, our economy might fall into depression and we will never recover from the debt. It is time of war, but we cannot destroy our economy for these new machines."
 EH_iron_man: "Iron Man?"
 EH_iron_man_desc: "First new mechs are already fighting on the battlefield. Now the true fight has started, where we may finally stand a chance against Invaders. Some people began to speculate, how far can we go with this technology. Of course, the Marvel fan base began sending us their blueprints of Iron Man armor... actually, why not?"
 EH_second_generation_hacs: "Second Generation HACS"
 EH_second_generation_hacs_desc: "Thanks to blueprints from nerds and professional engineers, we are ready to begin planning new mechs a bit earlier. Let's reach out for another great milestone!"
 EH_highly_purified_randallite: "Highly Purified Randallite"
 EH_highly_purified_randallite_desc: "We've never took enough time to clean up the raw Randallite, production was our top priority. But since we know more about this resource and we're not in such a hurry to discover it's new properties, we can take some time to maximize it's efficiency."
 EH_increase_research_budget: "Increase Research Budget"
 EH_increase_research_budget_desc: "The second HACS generation has been a great success, but we cannot rest on our laurels. The humanity will always call for something better, and that's the moment where we start preparation for the 3rd generation."
 EH_third_generation_hacs: "Third Generation HACS"
 EH_third_generation_hacs_desc: "All our hard work has led to this moment. Months of research, testing and billions from our budget, we are ready to release the greatest combat mech ever seen in the history of combat mechs!"
 EH_military_advantages: "Military Advantages"
 EH_military_advantages_desc: "We need to learn how Randallite will be able to help our troops. While the mechs are being constructed, we have more of this ore than we can spend on the new machines. We have to find more ways to use it."
 EH_ranjets: "Ranjets"
 EH_ranjets_desc: "Randallite has allowed us to build the first-ever combat mechs. It's so lightweight that we don't have to limit ourselves to just this new technology. This will solve many problems related to aircraft thrust and weight. Planes with lighter hulls will be able to carry more cargo and weapons, and our jets will be even more maneuverable than ever before."
 EH_not_so_heavy_weapons: "Not So Heavy Weapons"
 EH_not_so_heavy_weapons_desc: "We can use Randallite in heavy weapons production instead of steel, titanium, and other materials. The weapons will be lighter, and it will be easier for soldiers to carry and use them. Trucks will use less fuel for transportation, so everything benefits from this change."
 EH_find_new_veins: "Find New Veins"
 EH_find_new_veins_desc: "Many resource sites have been replaced with Randallite. We don't know how this process is progressing, but it may be a good time to start digging for more resources. Maybe we can find more Randallite underground."
 EH_more_precious_than_gold: "More Precious Than Gold"
 EH_more_precious_than_gold_desc: "Randallite is already everywhere. Huge companies are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on this resource. It's like a good old gold rush, but Randallite is far more useful than this resource. We can make common tools, machines and weapons and that's only a very shortened list. We, the state, have to find as much Randallite as possible before greedy businesses will put a monopoly on it's excavation, research and export. It's hard to believe we actually have to fight with our own nation, but putting restrictions may be the final consequence if the situation will get out of hand."
 EH_civilian_benefits: "Civilian Benefits"
 EH_civilian_benefits_desc: "Our war situation is stable, so we can focus on using Randallite in public spaces. If the situation with the Invaders gets worse, we can always switch to military production without many issues."
 EH_a_wonderful_prosthesis: "A Wonderful Prosthesis"
 EH_a_wonderful_prosthesis_desc: "The incredible endurance and lightweight nature of the Randallite allowed us to construct a new model of leg prosthesis, making its users even more \"healthy\" than they would be with their old leg. It is time to take synthetic extensions of the human body to a Cyberpunk-like level!"
 EH_market_potential: "Market Potential"
 EH_market_potential_desc: "There are a lot of people who want to get their hands on Randallite. Since we are no longer in a rush with military projects, we can start selling Randallite to investors and for commercial use. Big companies will start replacing their machines with ones made from Randallite, reducing the amount of fuel used around the world to power heavy machinery and vehicles."
 EH_study_new_enemy: "Study New Enemy"
 EH_study_new_enemy_desc: "After the nuclear strike on the mysterious Portal, a some sort of a new creatures began to spread in a circle around it. They are highly aggressive and they attack everything that moves. We don't know if we can stop them but if there is a way to defend against them, we have to find out how asap."
 EH_launch_orbital_scans: "Launch Orbital Scans"
 EH_launch_orbital_scans_desc: "We can use our satellites to study enemy maneuvers and learn they movement patterns, if they have any. This should help our strategists to prepare more effective traps and counter-tactics."
 EH_find_the_weak_spots: "Find The Weak Spots"
 EH_find_the_weak_spots_desc: "Those creatures can be killed. After all they are made out of blood and organic matter. If we manage to bring one of them into our laboratory, we might find their most crucial organs to study them for our advantage. As soon as we find out the critical organs, we will train our soldiers and combat systems to target them if possible."
 EH_disassemble_invader_armor: "Disassemble Invader Armor"
 EH_disassemble_invader_armor_desc: "Most of the Invaders are resistant to our weapons thanks to their hard chitin-like armor. We can begin research to learn its structure and adapt it to human body armor. Maybe this will make our troops slightly more resistant to enemy attacks."
 EH_portals_must_be_the_key: "Portals Must Be The Key"
 EH_portals_must_be_the_key_desc: "We have to gather more intel about the nearest Portal, anything that could be useful for us. They are resistant to nuclear strike but nothing is indestructible. We will find a way to close them even if it means we have to send our drones and aircraft on a suicide missions."
 EH_investigate_strange_structure: "Investigate Strange Structure"
 EH_investigate_strange_structure_desc: "We have noticed a strange behavior from our enemies. They seem to build something around the Portals, probably to secure it. If they are building some kind of fortress, we have to act fast before they'll separate them completely. Our next step is to prepare a detailed reconnaissance mission using our combat drones. The enemy is dominating the airzone so it's rather a suicide mission, but we have to hope at least one machine will manage to take any pictures of this structure and send it to our command."
 EH_finding_their_vulnerability: "Finding Their Vulnerability"
 EH_finding_their_vulnerability_desc: "With frequent enough bombardments we might find the weakness of the components this structure is built from. The most crucial things to check are heat and blast resistance, and toxic corrosion. There's no way we can check their freezing density but we can check the behavior of other materials from those monsters to see how they will react to lower temperatures."
 EH_but_how_does_this_key_work: "But How Does This Key Work?"
 EH_but_how_does_this_key_work_desc: "Those Portals lead to another dimension, that's for sure. Whether it is the Upside Down, Anti-Earth or whatever else, it should have anything that allows it to open and maintain the connection. Finding out how they are doing this may be important to understand their nature, functionality, and   perhaps, with a bit of luck   we will find a way to disrupt its work and terminate that connection."
 EH_project_tesla: "Project T.E.S.L.A."
 EH_project_tesla_desc: "Tactical Electromagnetic System of Linear Annihilation will be our greatest chance to show the monsters who's really in charge here. Once the weapon is ready, we will fire it at the nearest Portal. If our theory is correct, the electromagnetic pulse should be strong enough to interrupt the connections and, maybe, close it, temporary, or permanently."
 EH_whole_new_dawn: "Whole New Dawn"
 EH_whole_new_dawn_desc: "We know everything we should know to close the Portals. As long as we stick to the plan, we should be strong enough to finally end this war."
