French President [FRA.GetLeader] has taken a clear new authoritarian streak in terms of policies and rhetoric.\n\n[FRA.GetLeader] promises this will lead to fraternity between the brothers and sisters under the French flag - but international observers are skeptical.

 ### Country Events
 france_md.20.t: "The state of the centrist party"
 france_md.20.d: "Originally a centre-right party, the UDF has established itself as a centrist party, and in the past we were able to govern under President Valérie Giscard d'Estaing. Since then, however, we have been relegated to the background, sometimes serving during cohabitations, but overshadowed by the Republican Right and the Socialist Party. But the world is changing, and the neo-liberal trend is gaining ground in the West. Today, we are not very big, but there is no doubt that one day we will govern."
 france_md.20.a: "Yes, I can't wait!"
 france_md.21.t: "The state of the Republican Right"
 france_md.21.d: "Our party is as old as the republic and has governed since 1995 under Jacques Chirac's mandate, but he no longer has the wind in his sails. After a failed dissolution that forced him to take on a socialist prime minister, we are witnessing the rise of our rivals, be they the socialist party or the national front. Our country is, as ever, in financial difficulties and its interests are threatened everywhere abroad. One thing is certain: we are going to have to fight at home and abroad to assert France's power to those who might doubt it."
 france_md.21.a: "Let's get to work"
 france_md.22.t: "The state of the RPF"
 france_md.22.d: "Founded in 1999, the Rassemblement Pour la France (RPF) is a right-wing sovereignist party. Created by Charles Pasqua, it is strongly opposed to the European Union, against which it has worked hard. Our influence is minor for the moment, but the wheel is turning, the European Union is not only making people happy, and we are welcoming more and more dissidents from other parties, disappointed people who can't find the will to implement the Frexit elsewhere. We are of course the most Gaullist party in existence, and as this republic was founded by De Gaulle, we have no place in it other than Matignon!"
 france_md.22.a: "Vive le Général de Gaulle, Vive la France!"
 france_md.23.t: "The state of the National Front"
 france_md.23.d: "Founded in 1972 by Jean-Marie Le Pen and others with a questionable past, the Front National is a party of the extreme right. Since our creation, we have not been considered a serious party, because apart from us, the entire political landscape was against us, because we were the only ones who no longer wanted immigration. However, the situation has changed since then, and these same parties are beginning to realise that their attitude has led to chaos in our country. We are the forerunners in what will become a general trend of repression of immigration. But we're still being dismissed as untouchables and labelled as extremes, so there's no doubt about it: we're going to have to work to make our party acceptable to the assembly and to the electorate."
 france_md.23.a: "We'll get there!"
 france_md.24.t: "The state of the Socialist Party"
 france_md.24.d: "A historic rival of the Republican Right, our party is also of canonical age. The Republican Right is in great difficulty, and was even forced to leave us part of its mandate in cohabitation. We have a solid electoral base spread across most classes of the population, and our victory at the ballot box is inevitable. We advocate a more liberal approach than that of our forebears in order to adapt to the Europe we are building. However, we have to be careful because our party is facing major divisions, with our right wing only waiting for a sign of weakness on our part to rush headlong towards the liberal centre. Not to mention that our left wing could become radicalised if we push too hard towards liberalism. There's no doubt we'll win, but once we're on top, we'll be walking on eggshells."
 france_md.24.a: "Everything shall be fine."
 france_md.25.t: "The state of the Unbowed France"
 france_md.25.d: "The Socialist Party has failed to take left-wing ideals to the top, contenting itself with serving up soup to the centrists and dying torn between its two tendencies. Our party, La France Insoumise, therefore stands as the only true left-wing opposition to the neoliberal order. It was by seeking compromise indiscriminately that the Socialist Party buried itself, so we'll base our rhetoric on protest, even if it means attracting the wrath of the media. Our main project is also to build a new republic, putting an end to the presidential monarchy that we've had to put up with for far too long. Our party has been very successful, especially among young people, but we mustn't be content with that if we want to be in charge one day."
 france_md.25.a: "Another world is possible."
 france_md.26.t: "The state of the Greens"
 france_md.26.d: "The ecologist party in France has been around since 1984, but so far it hasn't had the success we'd hoped for. We are never taken seriously, and our electoral base is almost impossible to find outside urban centres. There's no doubt that if we're going to make our mark, we're going to have to deal with other parties and adapt to their way of seeing things. But given the state of the planet, there is no doubt that our presence at Matignon will eventually prove logical. Once there, we will strive to transform the way we live and produce, so as to ensure a future for generations to come. The obstacles are many, but there is no shortage of potential allies. "
 france_md.26.a: "We're running out of time."
 france_md.27.t: "The state of the French Communist Party"
 france_md.27.d: "The French Communist Party fell with the USSR, to which it was solidly attached. It's never easy to find yourself on the losing side. Our situation is more than critical: as we lose credibility, our working-class electoral base is drifting towards the far right or abstention. We need to reverse this trend and find new ways to win them over. We'll no doubt have to negotiate with other parties for a while, but perhaps once we're in charge we'll be able to regain the confidence of our former voters and regain our autonomy. Our party has a long history, and it can't stop now. "
 france_md.27.a: "We'll be back."

 france_md.30.t: "The direction of the economy"
 france_md.30.d: "The time has come to choose our finance minister. Our country is in urgent need of reform, so we have found 2 profiles who should meet our expectations in terms of finance. The first comes from within our ranks, a man by the name of Olivier Ferrand, who throughout his career in the economy has familiarised himself with this field. The second, a former finance inspector, is brand new to politics and supported our campaign.

Ces découvertes nous permettront d'aider aux démarches du FISC dans la chasse aux mauvais patriotes et de faire payer les entreprises ayants essayés de tricher chez nous. les Luxembourgeois ont peut-être grandement perdus en crédibilité bancaire mais grâce à eux nous mangeons aux frais de Bruxelle et de leur maudit libre échange !

De plus le peuple attend avec impatience l'arrivée des résulats de ses longs mois de questionnents de porte à porte et de commissions. Nous devons donc dès maintenant convoquer un réfférendum pour clore ces longs mois de dialogues. Cependant, il est également possible que durant le processus de création, nos adversaires politiques aient profités de cette grande remise en question pour glisser quelques textes qui servent leurs idéaux où qui les posent comme vainqueurs de ce processus. Pour autant ce texte bon ou mauvais devrait être porté aux urnes, sans quoi le peuple se sentirait a juste titre trahi.

Ce refus catégorique est très étonnant, peut-être est-ce dû à notre trop forte implication pour orienter les sujets et les débats qui ont laissés pensés à une manipulation de notre part. Ce peut-être aussi dû au fait que nos concitoyens demandaient en majoirité le changement sans être daccord sur la finalité. Ce projet de tout changer d'un coup était peut-être un peu osé. Néanmoins tout n'est pas perdu, nous pouvons encore faire circuler notre vision de ce que cette république aurait pû être juste en votant nos lois. Nous avons essayé d'écrire une nouvelle page dans l'histoire de la démocratie en Europe mais peut-être avons nous trop demandé d'un coup. "
 france_md.205.a: "Complètement incompréhensible"
 france_md.206.t: "Débats autours des institutions partie 1 :"
 france_md.206.d: "La question des institutions a toujours fait couler de l'encre. 5 république nées de victoires ou de défaites un régime changeant selon les époques. Si les mauvais souvenirs de la 4ème république subsistent, une république instable fragilisant l'état de l'intérieur jusqu'au putch d'Alger en 1958 où la république abdiqua en la faveur du général de Gaulle. Depuis la constitution de la 5ème république a été adoptée mais des tensions persistent notamment au sujet des pouvoirs présidentiels. Ceux-ci sont souvent perçus comme abusifs car conçus pour des hommes politiques de forte carrure qui sont malheurement devenus des perles rares. Les actuels pouvoirs permetteraient à quelqu'un de mal intentionné de bloquer toutes évolutions, voirs mêmes de s'affranchir des autres institutions par un manque alarmant de contre-pouvoirs. A l'inverse l'assemblée nationale bien qu'étant plus représentative du vote des français n'a en réalité qu'un pouvoir exclusif assez restreint et est souvent désignée comme contre productive ou inneficace due à l'impossibilité de décider de son calendrier. Un chapitre important du débat actuellement en cours réside donc dans la rénnovation de cette consitution d'un autre âge. Cependant la question se pose, jusqu'où pouvons l'a changer ? Nous avons le choix entre apporter notre soutient aux partisans d'un simple rééquilibrage des pouvoirs qui supprimerait des articles injustes ou trop dangereux, ce qui permettrait un rééquilibrage en la faveur du pouvoir législatif. Nous pouvons aussi revenir à un modèle plus proche de la 4ème république pour montrer au peuple que nous avons pris actes des abus orchestrés par l'executif précédent. Soutenir un rééquilibrage permettrait de retrouver le coeur des gens sans trop bousculer nos institutions, car il faut garder en tête qu'en donnant plus de pouvoir à l'assemblée on peut renforcer la confiance du peuple en ses institutions mais rendre le paysage politique plus modelable et sujet à luttes d'influences. Enfin nous pouvons juste laisser le peuple décider de lui même la manière dont il souhaite être gouverné, de manière à garder notre influence politique pour d'autres débats car il nous reste encore beaucoup à évoquer et trop nous impliquer donnerait l'impression qu'on tente de forcer la main aux électeurs. Il faut cependant faire attention car ne pas s'impliquer dans cette partie du débat pourrait laisser à nos adversaires politiques le choix de s'impliquer eux aussi, ils ne risquent rien, ce n'est pas eux qui signeront le texte final."

Bien évidemment l'article 49.3 a été la première cible de la colère populaire. Les pouvoirs présidentiels s'en tirent à bon comptes et le peuple semble satisfait de son travail. Un coup d'état démcratique semble maintenant moins possible, nos institutions gagnent en légitimité et en efficacité. Nous pouvons juste déplorer la légère déception de nos partisans les plus ardents à qui nous avions promis la fin de la monarchie préisdnetielle. Quoi que nous en pensions le peuple a donc tranché on peut maintenant s'intéresser aux débats suivants. "

 france_md.208.t: "La fin de la dictature présidentielle"
 france_md.208.d: "Les citoyens ont finis par se mettre daccord. La 5ème république avait emmagasiné trop de ressentiment dû aux décisions abusives des présidents précédents. Si elle était bien utile entres les mains d'hommes politiques de confiances et ayants un sens aigu de l'intérêt publique, on ne peut plus risquer dans le monde d'aujourd'hui de mettre autant de pouvoir entres les mains d'un seul homme qui pourrait même si ça lui chantait mettre fin à la république. Le président a donc fait office de fusible dans cette partie de débat. Ses pouvoirs sont maintenants limités à celui de chef de guerre et jolie plante verte du palais Burdon. L'assemblée est de nouveau toute puissance, si on peut voir ça comme une perte de stabilité, les réformes et les compromis se feront avec beaucoup plus d'aisance qu'avant. Même si le verdict du peuple réstreint votre champ d'action, il sert les intérêts du pays en augmantant la confiance des français dans leurs institutions. Et puis si vous n'êtes pas content de toute façon le débat est fini, il va maintenant falloir passer au débat suivant."

 france_md.209.t: "Débats autours des institutions partie 2 :"
 france_md.209.d: "En cette fin de débats que nous avons organisés autours du pouvoir des institutions, un sujet semble diviser no citoyens : celui des services secrets autres opérateurs sous-terrains dont le président a la responsabilité. En effet les services secrets français avant comme après la guerre froide ont toujours joués un rôle important dans la défense des intérêts français à l'intérieur comme à l'extérieure de celle-ci. Les services secrets changeants parfois de noms et de méthodes furent parfois à l'origine de bavures et de règlements de comptes comme la tuerie d'Auriol en 1981. Si ces services sont particulièrement efficaces pour faire pression sur des gouvernements rivaux, et surtout pour lutter contre les nouvelles formes de guerres de l'information et contre le terrorisme, ils posent des problèmes de transparence. En effet le principe même de ces unités spéciales habilités à mener des action en dehors du cadre légal pour la sauvegarde de l'intérêt général pose tout de même du respect du concept  d'état de droit. Nous avons toujours milités pour une république plus transparente et nos soutient pourraient se retrouver déçus si nous ne mettons pas notre programme à execution, de plus, plus de transparence renforcerait la confiance des citoyens envers leurs institutions et leurs forces armées tout en réduisant le coup de la dissimulation de celles-ci. Cependant, la sureté de notre état dans un monde de plus en plus instable est un sujet qu'on ne peut prendre à la légère. Comme d'habitude nous pouvons aussi laisser les électeurs trancher eux mêmes mais nos adversaires conservateurs pourraient essayer d'influencer le débat. "

En effet, surtout par les temps qui courent, notre défense passive doit être aux premières loges pour nous protéger des actions malveillantes venues de l'étranger et contre le terrorisme. Ce résulat a cependant déçu nos militants qui souhaitaient plus de transparence et de démocracie. Beaucoup de nos concityens persistent à penser que la défence de notre pays ne doit pas se faire au prix de leur vie privée en temps de paix. Certains craignent de plus la mauvaise utilisation de ces services par des gouvernements mal intentionnés pour espionner leur opposition ou pour éviter les fuites en direction de l'opposition... Les électeurs ont cependant tranchés et ils ont fait le choix de la sécurité avant la liberté. C'est leur choix après tout... "

Nos interventions à l'étrangers donnent de plus souvent matière à des polémiques internationales, ce que notre peuple préfererait ne pas découvrir dans le journal à chaques fois que la situation nous échaperait. Cette nouvelle transparence donnera à nos citoyens une confiance plus importantes envers leur police et leurs forces armées ce dont nous avons bien besoins en ce moment. Nos institutions gagnent en légitimité et c'est au prix d'une partie de notre sécurité intérieur et de notre influence extérieur. Regretteront nous ce choix ? Le temps nous le dira."

 france_md.215.d: "Notre pays est très connu pour ses nombreuses périodes de troubles partants d'en bas ainsi que pour avoir un peuple difficilement gouvernable. Quel que soit le resultat des élections il se retrouvera un jour ou l'autre dans la rue pour manifester son mécontentement. Cependant unes des manières d'éviter celà est de ne pas le provoquer mais plutôt de l'écouter car c'est de lui seul dont provient la légitimité d'un gouvernement. Ce n'est donc pas un hasard si la question de la protection des citoyens en manifestations est à l'ordre du jour. Débordement d'un coté ou de l'autre du bouclier ? Ce qui est sûr c'est qu'un très grand nombre de manifestations se sont finis avec des blessés et des estropiés. Il serait donc judicieux pour notre gouvernement comme pour les suivants d'encadrer de manière plus efficace les forces de police chargés de faire respecter l'ordre et de protéger des citoyens éxercants leur droit à protester. Eviter de potentielles répressions permettra au peuple de mieux controler des élites qui auraient potentiellement perdues la tête mais celà entraînera aussi un surcoup en matière de police. D'un autre côté le maintien de l'ordre est aussi une priorité quand les mouvements se radicalisent, il est aussi important de minimiser les chances d'un débordement pouvant entrainer de la casse matérielle et humaine. Quel côté du débat devrions nous discrêtement favoriser ? Priorisons nous la protection contre les débordements ou contre la casse humaine et matérielle ? Nous pouvons aussi garder nos forces pour nous impliquer dans un autre débat.  "

Les technologies de maintien de l'ordre se perfectionnant, nous sommes déjà un pays fortement efficace sur ce plan, pas besoin d'aller plus loin. De plus éviter de graves blessures physiques chez les manifestants fera sûrement baisser les dépenses de santé. L'état également plus de comptes à rendre à son peuple, vu que celui-ci pourra moins dangereusement protester dans la rue.

Les discussions semblent se polariser autours du principe du développement durable : ecologique social et economique. Qui placer en haut de la liste des entités à protéger ? En plaçant le social nous placerions en premier la création et protection des emplois et des personnes. Cependant l'écologie pourrait passer au 2nd plan et l'endettement qui en résultera pourrait dégrader la confiance des investisseurs. En privilegiant l'écologie, nous améliorerions la qualité de vie de nos habitants et nous tournerions vers de nouvelles sources d'énergies. Cependant, nous laisserions de coté des sources de revenus pour certains et des investissements pour d'autres. Nous pourrions aussi semer le trouble en soutenant avant tout l'économie et faire croire à l'implications d'une autre faction, mais celà serait risqué vis à vis de nos miliants.

Their influence operations have succeeded beyond their expectations - local politicians now openly call for our departure, and the Lebanese government has formally requested we withdraw our presence.

Every Saturday, hundreds of thousands of protesters wearing yellow high-visibility vests flood the streets and block roundabouts across the country.

 france_md.921.t: "The De-demonization Debate"
 france_md.921.d: "The National Rally faces a fundamental strategic choice. For years, the party has been treated as a pariah by mainstream politics - a 'cordon sanitaire' preventing any cooperation with it. Now, some within the party argue for softening its image, distancing itself from its most extreme elements, and presenting a more moderate face to broaden its appeal.

 france_md.932.t: "Student and Youth Uprising"
 france_md.932.d: "Universities across France have erupted in protest. Students are occupying buildings, blocking entrances, and clashing with riot police. The immediate trigger was a controversial labor law that students see as an attack on worker protections, but their grievances run deeper - high youth unemployment, precarious job prospects, and a sense that the political system ignores their concerns. The protests evoke memories of May 1968."
 france_md.932.a: "Withdraw the controversial policy"

What began as isolated incidents after a confrontation with police has spread across the country, with thousands of cars burned and dozens of buildings damaged.

 # EU Referendum (952)

Opponents - spanning both left and right - argue that it undermines French sovereignty and benefits elites at the expense of ordinary citizens. The vote is too close to call, and the government must decide how actively to campaign for a 'Yes' vote."

 france_md.952.b: "Let the campaign unfold naturally"
 france_md.952.c: "Avoid risking a referendum"

 # Left Coalition (953)
 france_md.953.t: "Left-Wing Coalition Forms"
 france_md.953.d: "In response to the fractured political landscape, left-wing parties are attempting to form a unified coalition. Socialists, communists, greens, and the radical left are in negotiations to present a common front to voters.
