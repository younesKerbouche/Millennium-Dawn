 CPD_peace_deal_explainer_ICON_TT_DELAYED: "Constructing a peace deal is as simple as selecting a tab above and then choosing what to concede or demand within a state.\n\nBuilding a peace deal that has a §Ynegative§! cost will likely be accepted by an AI, whereas building a peace deal that has a §Ypositive§! cost is less likely to be accepted. You can see the full breakdown of the AI's willingness to accept a deal by hovering over the acceptance box.\n\nAny peace deal built for a player is not affected by these values."
