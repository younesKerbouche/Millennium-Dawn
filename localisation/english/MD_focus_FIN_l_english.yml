# EVENTS #
 Finland.1.t: "Conscription Reform"
 Finland.1.d: "The Finnish military has held strong onto its conscription laws even after the main threat to Finnish sovereignty, the Soviet Union, stopped to exist. Nowadays, Finnish conscription laws seems archaic, with men and women not being treated equally under who gets to serve or not to serve in civilian or military service at how long or at what punishment when refusing to serve.\n\nSome argue that conscription should be abolished and that both the money and the freed up workforce could then profit the civilian economy. More conservative thinkers point to the Russian Federation as 'the Soviet Union but less red', with a possible Russian willingness to re-establish global ambition posing a very real threat to Finnish independence."
 Finland.1.a: "The Status Quo is satisfactory."
 Finland.1.b: "Conscription is costly and useless. Abolish it."
 Finland.1.c: "Every man and woman a soldier!"
 Finland.2.t: "Timber Export Policy"
 Finland.2.d: "Timber is one of Finland's most important natural resources. Finnish trees are of high quality and internationally rather desired - but is our current policy regarding the speed of woodcutting realistic?"
 Finland.2.a: "Maximize Production."
 Finland.2.b: "A long-term approach is more viable."
 Finland.3.t: "Expansion of the Financial Ministry"
 Finland.3.d: "The Valtiovarainministeriö, the Finnish ministry of finance, is always a significant part of the political debate. How should the budgetary commissions function? How will the state employees be paid? How is the government's economic and financial policy to be shaped and is the chosen way valid?"
 Finland.3.a: "Investment is the way!"
 Finland.3.b: "A hands-off approach is preferable."
 Finland.4.t: "Economic Doctrine"
 Finland.4.d: "The new millennium will be a very stressful time for Finnish business and enterprise, and the government of Finland needs to properly prepare a long-term strategy in order to secure employment and prosperity in the country."
 Finland.4.a: "Keeping Finnish money in Finland is preferable."
 Finland.4.b: "Trading with the EU is the answer."
 Finland.5.t: "Foreign Policy Doctrine"
 Finland.5.d: "Finland has always been in a precarious spot on the world map, trapped between Russia on one side and nations that want to stay away from Russia on the other. Finnish foreign policy is not just a game of well-dressed men in ball rooms, it is a question of national survival. Finland is not to become the chessboard of a NATO advance into Russia and it is also not to become a Russian oblast either."
 Finland.5.a: "The world is in balance and the balance needs to be kept."
 Finland.5.b: "The government needs to hire additional diplomats."
 Finland.6.t: "Military Policy"
 Finland.6.d: "The prospect of Russian invasion is one of the defining policy points of Finnish politics. Our ministry of defense, the Puolustusministeriö, is in charge of actually keeping our nation alive (unlike many other similar government agencies) and needs to be given solid pointers regarding the question where to go."
 Finland.6.a: "The army is most important."
 Finland.6.b: "Let's experiment."
 Finland.7.t: "The Finnish Monarchy"
 Finland.7.d: "Frederik Kaarle I is the Finnish name of Friedrich Karl, the German prince from Hesse-Kassel that almost became King of Finland in 1918. His descendants were rather reluctant to step forward when our government published plans to establish a German monarchy friendly to the imperial government in Berlin - primarily because of how unpopular the idea is in the Finnish public.\n\nFinally, Donatus Philipp Umberto, the great-grandson of Friedrich Karl but also a great-grandson of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, has stepped forward and presented himself as an option to the Finnish government.\n\nHe will do fine. But his role is yet to be determined."
 Finland.7.a: "He needs to lead Finland!"
 Finland.7.b: "He shall be our constitutional monarch."
 Finland.8.t: "Finland offers CSTO Membership - at a price"
 Finland.8.d: "Finland had, over the past few years and especially the last few months, voluntarily approached Russia in friendship and assistance, and while Finnish-Russian friendship clubs were formed in St Petersburg and Helsinki, it seems like the Finns have different plans.\n\nThey are demanding huge amounts of money, essentially selling their loyalty."
 Finland.8.a: "We accept."
 Finland.8.b: "We laugh in their face."
 Finland.9.t: "Finland offers Mutual Defensive Agreement"
 Finland.9.d: "Both Finland and Sweden are connected in their attempts to stay neutral. The Finnish government has approached us with an offer to formalize our mutual interests and our binational relationship through a two-way guarantee of independence. That is a great idea: It's an alliance, but not really, but really."
 Finland.9.a: "Good idea!"
 Finland.9.b: "No, thanks"
