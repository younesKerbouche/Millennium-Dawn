In recent years tensions have flared up, with many indigenous protests over issue like lack of rights and water access. It is important to keep the opinion of these groups at stable levels, otherwise we may get two different kinds of instability from both sides, Therefore we must tread carefully as one bad decision can lead to the fracturing of Bolivia as we know it.\n\n§RIf Indigenous Opinion falls below 15, Indigenous groups will demand the resignation of our government by means of mass protest, and if we do not comply to their demands the Indigenous People of Western Bolivia will revolt against the government.§!\n\n§YIf Mestizo opinion falls under 15, the historically influential and pro-mestizo [Nat_Autocracy_L] will demand the resignation of our government and the placement of a pro-mestizo interim government until early elections are held, but if we do not comply the Military will launch a coup and install a military regime in power.§!\n\nMestizo Opinion: [?BOL_mestizo_support]\n\nIndigenous Opinion: [?BOL_indigenous_support]"

While compliance will lead to the undermining of democratic institutions, it will at least avoid a repeat of Bolivia's many military dictatorships, which ended in 1982. However We also must not allow the Army to intervene in politics, and we can try and resist their pressures, which however may lead to drastic consequences. Whatever choice we make it will drastically affect Bolivia's future."

Fearing a new military regime like in the past, the government complied and stepped down and [BOL.GetLeader] was later sworn in as Bolivia's new interim president. while [BOL.GetLeader] claims that the new government is restoring democratic rule, many commentators have agreed that the new government has taken a harsh anti-indigenous stance with many reports of use of force against indigenous protests by the Bolivian Armed Forces."

Fearing a new military regime like in the past, the government refused to comply and instead the military stormed the capital of La Paz, seizing the presidential palace and congress. Later the military declared a state of emergency and stated that they shall 'restore Bolivia's rightful place in Latin America', which many commentators agree will raise new regional tensions, and also put a bad track record on Bolivia's democracy which experienced the 191th coup since it's declaration of independence in 1825, the last being in 1980.
