 BUL_liberty_ethos_desc: "The year 2000 was a turning point for Bulgarian society as it faced numerous political, economic and social challenges. Despite the difficulties, there is no doubt that the democratic ethos was the best choice for the country. Democracy offers citizens the opportunity to have a say in their government and participate in decision-making processes. This creates a sense of ownership, empowering individuals to take responsibility for their collective destinies. Additionally, democratic societies place great emphasis on individual rights and freedoms, which are critical for personal and societal development."
 BUL_collectivist_ethos: "New Bulgaria, old ways"
 BUL_collectivist_ethos_desc: "The year 2000 marked the start of Bulgaria's democratic establishment. However, many people view it as the worst political leadership in the country's history. One of the primary reasons why it is deemed as such is the fact that the government failed to counter the rampant corruption that plagued the nation. Another factor that contributed to this negative perception was the lack of progress and economic growth. Instead, poverty and unemployment remained prevalent, and the living standards continued to decline. There was also a growing sense of political instability, which eroded public trust and confidence in the government."

 bulg.4.t: "Monarchist Coup in Bulgaria!"
 bulg.4.d: "Bulgaria was hit by a monarchist coup that brought back symbols of the country's former monarchy. The coup was led by a faction within the Bulgarian political leadership, who sought to bring back a constitution similar to the one present in the pre-communist era. This move was met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as an attempt to move Bulgaria towards authoritarianism, while others believed that the restoration of the monarchy would bring stability to the country's politics. The coup was successful, and the new constitution featured the monarchy as a ceremonial head of state. The Bulgarian royal family was granted a significant role in the country's political and social life, and they continue to hold a prominent position in Bulgarian society to this day. With the current government plagued by corruption and economic instability, there is a growing movement in Bulgaria dedicated to the restoration of the monarchy. Led by a group of influential politicians, military leaders and loyalists to the former royal family, this movement seeks to create a constitutional monarchy that will bring stability and prosperity to the nation."

This was a significant political shift in the country following years of democratic reforms and liberalization. For many Bulgarians, it was a step back towards the communist regime that they had fought so hard to remove. The BSP was able to gain power through a coalition government with the Movement for Rights and Freedoms party. This coalition essentially gave the BSP control of the government, allowing them to implement policies that were reminiscent of the communist era. They implemented more state control over the economy, limiting private enterprise, and increasing government spending on social policies."

The country was still recovering from the economic and political turmoil of the 1990s, and there was a growing sense of frustration among the people towards the government. The ruling party, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), had been in power since 1995 and was facing increasing criticism for its handling of the economy and corruption allegations. In this context, the presidential elections of 2000 were a crucial moment for the country. The incumbent president, Petar Stoyanov, ran for re-election as an independent candidate, promising to continue his pro-European and pro-market reforms. He faced a tough challenge from the BSP's candidate, Georgi Parvanov, who promised a return to socialist policies and closer ties with Russia. In the end, Stoyanov won a narrow victory, securing a second term in office. However, Parvanov's strong showing signaled a shift in the political climate"

Bulgaria claims that parts of the Republic of North Macedonia's national identity and language have been artificially constructed in a bid to strengthen its own territorial claim. However, North Macedonia has consistently denied this, stating that such allegations are baseless and unfounded. In recent times, both nations have shown a willingness to negotiate and work towards a resolution. The European Union has also played a significant role in mediating and facilitating talks between the two sides. A resolution of this dispute would be crucial to furthering regional cooperation and reducing tensions among the Balkan states. Macedonia could lose it's sovereignty because of this conflict..."

 bulg.13.t: "Bulgarian Industry"

The country had experienced a period of hyperinflation in the early 1990s, followed by a period of stabilization and gradual economic growth. However, in 1996, Bulgaria suffered a severe economic crisis which was partly the result of a banking system collapse and a sharp depreciation of the national currency. By the year 2000, Bulgaria's economy was slowly recovering from the crisis, but still faced a number of challenges. The country's GDP was growing at a moderate rate, but unemployment remained high and poverty levels were significant. The government was implementing a range of economic reforms aimed at reducing the budget deficit, improving public finances, and promoting foreign investment."
