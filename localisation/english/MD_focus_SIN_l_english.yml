 ##Leader Descriptions
 GOH_CHOK_TONG_DESC: "Goh Chok Tong was first elected Prime Minister in 1990, winning with a comfortable majority. Tong's ascension to PM and his early years as PM are littered with abnormalities. Goh became Prime Minister after Lee Kuan Yew stepped down in later 1990. Goh proceeded to call a snap election then. It was a landslide for the PAP and allowed Goh to usher in a new mandate.\n\nAlthough, he is not as notable as his predecessor Lee Kuan Yew. Goh made strides with his policies that supported 'little bohemias' within the city."

He has overseen significant infrastructural developments, strengthening Singapore's position as a global hub for finance, technology, and trade. His administration has also prioritised long-term sustainability, addressing climate change and promoting social inclusivity. Lee's emphasis on pragmatic policies and his commitment to maintaining Singapore's stability have been instrumental in navigating complex regional and global challenges. He continues to guide Singapore through the complexities of the 21st century, maintaining a focus on economic growth, social progress, and national security. His legacy as a leader of Singapore is still being written, but his contributions to the nation's economic and social development are undeniable."
 LAWRENCE_WONG_DESC: "Lawrence Wong, latest Prime Minister. His leadership is marked by a pragmatic approach to governance, balancing economic growth with social well-being. He champions technological innovation, recognising its potential to propel Singapore to new heights. Wong's focus extends beyond economics; he prioritises social harmony and inclusivity, ensuring that all Singaporeans benefit from the nation's progress. His policies reflect a commitment to sustainable development, ensuring Singapore's prosperity for generations to come. He fosters collaboration, building strong partnerships both domestically and internationally.

His leadership inspires confidence, positioning Singapore as a beacon of stability and progress in a dynamic world. He is a champion of social mobility, ensuring opportunities for all.
