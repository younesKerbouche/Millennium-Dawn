 hungary_historical.1.d: "Today, [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong] Zoltán Pokorni has been attacked during an election forum in Püspökladány with ten young activists, around six o'clock on Friday and tried to break into the upstairs restaurant with a pillow in their hands. With the pillows, they wanted to draw the attention of politicians to get some sleep instead of talking. According to the testimony of the leader of the group, they also organized the previous action, during which a cake was pressed into the face of Mayor Gábor Demszky. A police found a butterfly knife on one of the attackers, who was taken to the police station for questioning. The Fidesz politician was not injured in the attack."
