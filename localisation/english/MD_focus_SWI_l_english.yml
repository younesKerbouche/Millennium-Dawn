# EVENTS #
 switzerland.2.t: "End of the Swiss Political System"
 switzerland.2.d: "The democracy in Switzerland, once viewed as a role model and a shining star of inspiration for all those seeking more popular involvement in government due to the possibilities given to the Swiss citizens, is no more.\n\nThe Swiss leader [SWI.GetLeader] has announced that these \"Distractions from Public Life\" and \"Unnecessary Referendums\" would stop taking place."
 switzerland.2.o1: "Good riddance."
 switzerland.2.o2: "Such a shame."
 switzerland.2.o3: "Whatever."
 switzerland.3.t: "Invitation to the Swiss Alliance"
 switzerland.3.d: "In order to protect our mutual international sovereignty, Switzerland has invited us to their alliance of neutrality and multinational safety."
 switzerland.3.o1: "We accept!"
 switzerland.3.o2: "No"
 switzerland.4.t: "The Alpine Republic"
 switzerland.4.d: "Switzerland has proclaimed the union of Alpine states into the Alpine Republic - and has asked us to join."
 switzerland.4.o1: "For the Alps!"
 switzerland.4.o2: "Uhh, no."
 switzerland.5.t: "Swiss Threats"
 switzerland.5.d: "With a new military faction at their backs, the Swiss have now descended upon us and sent our country a threat to 'stop posing a threat to the Swiss government, people and the countries and peoples allied with Switzerland'. Switzerland also transmitted to us a program of twenty-one points to follow - but accepting would de facto result in our annexation into the Swiss Confederation."
 switzerland.5.o1: "We have to accept."
 switzerland.5.o2: "Never! FREEDOM!"
 switzerland.6.t: "The End of Switzerland"
 switzerland.6.d: "Now confirmed by referendum: The Swiss state will cease to exist. The German and Romansh parts of the country will seek statehood in the Federal Republic, the Romagne will seek accession to France and the Italian parts of Switzerland will become an Italian province."
 switzerland.6.o1: "All good things must come to an end."
 switzerland.7.t: "Adolf Ogi becomes President"
 switzerland.7.d: "The President of Switzerland is a position that switches between the seven members of the Swiss Federal Councils in annual cycles.\n\nAdolf Ogi of the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party took over the position for the year 2000. He had already presided over the council successfully in 1993."
 switzerland.7.o1: "Good choice"
 switzerland_news.1.t: "Switzerland joins the UN"
 switzerland_news.1.d: "Originally, the Swiss government had refused to join the United Nations after the end of the Second World War, pointing to the country's continued dedication to its own neutrality - which is especially weird considering the UN's main seat in Europe is the UNOG, the United Nations Office in Geneva.\n\nNow, after a public referendum on the matter, the Swiss government has announced that the country would move forward to abandon its post as a spectator and would now join the organization as a full member."
 switzerland_news.1.o1: "It's about time, Switzerland!"
 switzerland_news.1.o2: "And what about us?"
 switzerland_news.1.o3: "Is it really that big of a deal?"
 switzerland_news.2.t: "The End of Swiss Neutrality"
 switzerland_news.2.d: "Switzerland's commitment to international neutrality and non-alignment in times of both peace and war goes back to the year 1516, when the Swiss Confederacy stopped its policy of expansion after a defeat at French hands. Swiss secession from the Holy Roman Empire in 1648 helped the country further that stance. The final step was in 1815, when all major powers acknowledged and guaranteed Swiss neutrality in the post-Napoleonic Congress of Vienna.\n\nThis era of Swiss history is now over. The president of the federal council, [SWI.GetLeader], has announced that Switzerland would no longer continue to honor its oaths of old and has formally absolved the major powers previously guaranteeing its independence off their duty to do so."
 switzerland_news.2.o1: "A significant development?"
 switzerland_news.2.o2: "The dawn of a new age!"
 switzerland_news.3.t: "[SWI.GetLeader] confirms Swiss Neutrality"
 switzerland_news.3.d: "The Swiss federal council, backed up by the parliament and the cantons, has today once again affirmed Swiss non-intervention in international conflicts.\n\n[SWI.GetLeader] has commented that membership in an international coalition will not only bring peril to the Swiss people but also encouraged the world to do the same."
 switzerland_news.3.o1: "That's not really news..."
 switzerland_news.3.o2: "Switzerland saving the day!"
 switzerland_news.4.t: "The Swiss Protection League"
 switzerland_news.4.d: "In a move creating a political union that is very close to a military faction (but of course officially not a military faction), the Swiss defensive ministry has gotten parliamentary support for the creation of a 'Swiss Protection League' (which has, as is custom in Switzerland, four different official names in the various languages of the country).\n\nThis seems to be the next big step in further armed 'neutrality' of Switzerland."
 switzerland_news.4.o1: "Armed Neutrality indeed."
 switzerland_news.5.t: "The Alpine Republic"
 switzerland_news.5.d: "The Swiss government has sent requests to the governments of Liechtenstein and Austria to approve of legislation to join the Swiss Confederation in the form of 20 new cantons.\nAt the same time, Switzerland has also officially changed its name to 'The Republic of the Alps' or 'Alpine Republic' for short.\n\nVaduz and Vienna are yet to respond, but chances for unification seem surprisingly good. Liechtenstein has been guaranteed the right to preserve its monarch as permanent head of the canton even in the Republican form of government and Austria has been guaranteed 49% of the seats in the new parliament, with 45% going to the four national communities of Switzerland and 6% to Liechtenstein."
 switzerland_news.5.o1: "Redefining neutrality since 1516."
 switzerland_news.6.t: "The End of the Swiss Confederation"
 switzerland_news.6.d: "In a world shattering referendum, the cantons of Switzerland have all unanimously voted to divide Switzerland among linguistic lines into three entities, a German-Romansh, a French and an Italian one. All of those entities have further already confirmed plans to be absorbed into the respective linguistic motherland.\n\nThis marks the end of Swiss Independence. The country has existed without interruption since the legendary Rütlischwur of 1307."
 switzerland_news.6.o1: "All countries must eventually perish."
