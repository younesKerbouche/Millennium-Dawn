The plan promises amnesty to militants who lay down their arms, reintegration for repentant fighters, and compensation for the families of victims. Supporters hail the charter as the best chance to finally end Algeria’s decade of bloodshed, while critics argue that it risks forgiving perpetrators of violence without delivering true justice. The nation watches anxiously to see if this bold move will secure lasting peace."

For them, Sharia represents a higher law, uncorrupted by the greed of politicians, the betrayal of the Harkis, or the influence of foreign powers. This is not a war against the Algerian people, but against the corrupt officials and foreign-backed elites who have stolen their future.

While the intensity of fighting has decreased, tensions remain high, and the wounds are far from healed.\n\nWith the nation's future uncertain, competing forces now push in different directions. One path seeks national reconciliation and democratic reforms to unify the country. Another leans toward prolonging emergency rule, maintaining the current regime's grip on power. Yet a third whispers of continued war — of unfinished battles, radical promises, and those who refuse to lay down arms.\n\nThe road Algeria chooses next may shape its destiny for generations."

 nuclear_algeria.6.d: "The Algerian government has asked us to sell them a series of Ballistic Missiles. It has declared that they will use the missiles to protect their national borders, and will not use it in any form of offensive warfare."

 nuclear_algeria.13.d: "The time has come, we have made it far enough in our nuclear program to begin negotiating with the west to finally leverage some benefits other states currently do not possess.

 nuclear_algeria.14.d: "The Algerian government has come forth with documents, photos, and other evidence proving that they currently possess the capability to produce nuclear weapons, if they don't already have them at hand. Our administration is quite perplexed by this move, as the world has speculated that the Algerians have been trying to produce nuclear weapons for some time now, with claims of this being denied by Algeria. However it is suspected that Algeria is doing this as a way to blackmail us and the rest of the world into giving them benefits that we otherwise would not grant them. Regardless, we will need to lift sanctions on them, and whether we do it on our own terms or theirs will still need to be decided."
 nuclear_algeria.14.a: "Fine, what do they want?"

 nuclear_algeria.15.t: "United States Demands the Dismantling of All Nuclear Facilities and Weapons"
 nuclear_algeria.15.d: "The United States has responded to our more than reasonable, and logical proposal of negotiation with a threat. They have demanded that we dismantle all of our nuclear weapons technology, as well as comply with the terms of the IAEA. However, the United States has offered to lift sanctions if we do decide to cooperate with them, but this is just not the way we expected them to react."

 nuclear_algeria.17.t: "Algeria Rebuffs Our Terms"
 nuclear_algeria.17.d: "The Algerian government has decided that it wants to play with fire, and has decided that it wants to reject our generous offer. As a result, we will be able to pursue several options at hand, from sanctions to outright intervention."
 nuclear_algeria.17.a: "Sanctions on their industries, and key persons of interest"

 nuclear_algeria.18.t: "United States Calls for Intervention Against Algeria"
 nuclear_algeria.18.d: "The United States has recently declared the Algeria has crossed a redline that it should not have.

 nuclear_algeria.21.a: "We will see"
 nuclear_algeria.22.t: "Algeria Offers Cheap Oil"
 nuclear_algeria.22.d: "Algeria has offered its oil to us at a discounted price. This is as a result of crippling sanctions placed upon them by Western powers, and their friends. This has crippled Algeria's economy, and as a result, they are forced to sell off their oil at a cheaper price."

 nuclear_algeria.26.a: "Good"
 nuclear_algeria.27.t: "Algeria Begins Acting Erratically"
 nuclear_algeria.27.d: "Algeria has once more began acting more like a pariah state instead of a civilized one. We must reconsider our stance on sanctions."

 nuclear_algeria.28.t: "Algeria Falls in Line"

 ALG_ali_belhadj_desc:0 "Ali Belhadj, co-founder of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), was one of the most charismatic and radical Islamist leaders of Algeria’s turbulent 1990s. Known for his fiery sermons, uncompromising rhetoric, and rejection of secular politics, he became a symbol of resistance to the FLN regime. Imprisoned for much of the civil war and banned from formal politics under the 1996 Constitution, Belhadj remains a polarizing figure — for some, the embodiment of Islamist grievance; for others, a dangerous reminder of the Black Decade. His potential return to the political stage raises both hopes of reconciliation and fears of renewed extremism."
 ALG_bouamrane_desc:0 "Mohamed Bouamrane emerged in the 1990s as a more moderate Islamist intellectual and political actor. Advocating dialogue over confrontation, he positioned himself between hardline Islamists like Ali Belhadj and the entrenched FLN elite. While never achieving the same mass appeal as the FIS leadership, Bouamrane became a respected figure in post-war debates on reconciliation and constitutional reform. His vision emphasized an Algeria where Islamic values could coexist with democratic institutions, making him a bridge figure in the tense balance between secular and religious politics."

 ALG_pulse.1.t: "Sahara Desert Expands"
 ALG_pulse.1.d: "According to the latest data, the Sahara continues its steady expansion. Grazing areas are turning barren, oases are drying up, and wildlife such as gazelles and Barbary deer are disappearing due to poaching. Overgrazing, unchecked mining and ignoring poaching will only worsen the desertification."
 ALG_pulse.1.a: "A worrying sign"

 ALG_sahara_expansion: "Sahara Desertification"
 ALG_sahara_expansion_desc: "The Sahara Desert dominates much of Algeria, stretching across the south and encroaching steadily northwards. Each year, the process of desertification worsens as fragile ecosystems give way to expanding arid zones. With only a fraction of Algeria’s land suitable for farming, much of the rural population depends on limited arable land, irrigation projects, and fragile grazing areas that are increasingly under strain.\n\nThe Algerian Sahara also contains valuable natural resources, including oil and gas fields, as well as unique ecosystems and communities such as the Tuareg in the Hoggar region. Balancing exploitation of these resources with the urgent need to combat desertification will be a defining challenge.\n\n§YEvery January§! we will receive an update on the desertification status of the Sahara. The desert may continue to expand (§YDesertification§!), the situation may stabilize (§YStabilisation§!), or efforts could succeed in reversing the process (§YOasification§!). The chances of each outcome can be viewed in the §Y$ALG_anti_desertification_decisions$§! decision category.\n\nWe can continue extracting resources and grazing on fragile lands, worsening desertification, or we can take a conservationist and sustainable development approach to slow or even reverse the trend."

 ALG_anti_poaching_decisions: "Poaching in the Sahara"
 ALG_anti_poaching_decisions_desc: "Poaching in Algeria’s Sahara remains a persistent problem. Endangered species such as the addax, gazelles, and desert cheetahs are hunted for trade or sport, while smuggling routes often link these activities to wider criminal and terrorist networks across the Sahel. Some poachers come from neighbouring Mali, Niger, and Libya, though local groups are also involved. Algerian authorities have taken a hard stance on §Ypoachers§!, and clashes between them and security forces are not uncommon.\n\nPoaching (together with overgrazing, climate change, and unsustainable land use) contributes to the continuing desertification of the Sahara.

 ALG_anti_poaching_dehorn_camels: "Camel Marking Campaign"
 ALG_anti_poaching_dehorn_camels_desc: "Marking and closely monitoring camel herds across the Sahara could help discourage poachers and smugglers. While camels are not endangered, they are often targeted for smuggling routes or illegal trade.

 ALG_increase_cattle_grazing: "Expand Cattle Grazing"
 ALG_increase_cattle_grazing_desc: "Livestock herding remains a cornerstone of Algeria’s steppe and high plateau economy. Expanding cattle and sheep grazing could boost rural incomes, but it risks worsening overgrazing, soil degradation, and desertification if not managed carefully."

 ALG_optimize_pastoral_practices: "Optimize Pastoral Practices"
 ALG_optimize_pastoral_practices_desc: "Traditional grazing methods have placed enormous strain on fragile ecosystems. By introducing rotational grazing, sustainable water use, and improved veterinary care, we can modernize pastoral practices and reduce their impact on the steppe and Sahara margins."

 ALG_expand_steppe_farming: "Expand Steppe Farming"
 ALG_expand_steppe_farming_desc: "The steppe regions of Algeria, located between the Tell Atlas and the Sahara, are vital for grain and livestock production.

 ALG_shrink_nature_reserves_sahara: "Shrink Sahara Nature Reserves"
 ALG_shrink_nature_reserves_sahara_desc: "Some argue that large portions of land set aside as nature reserves in the Sahara could be repurposed for agriculture, grazing, or industrial projects. Reducing the size of these reserves would allow development, but at great environmental cost."

 ALG_expand_nature_reserves_sahara: "Expand Sahara Nature Reserves"

 ALG_black_decade_lesson: "Lessons of the Black Decade"
 ALG_black_decade_lesson_desc: "The civil war of the 1990s scarred the nation deeply, leaving behind a generation wary of extremism and instability. The state has drawn hard lessons from this dark chapter — focusing on preserving national unity, strengthening security institutions, and avoiding the chaos of ideological confrontation. However, these lessons also justify a continued grip of the old guard over politics, as fear of a repeat still shapes every reform."
 AlgeriaElections.1.t: "The Elections"
 AlgeriaElections.1.d: "For the first time in years, Algeria is witnessing truly competitive elections. The air is charged with both anticipation and tension as millions of citizens head to the polls, determined to shape their nation’s future after decades of political stagnation. Two main forces dominate the landscape.\n\nThe first, an alliance of reformist, liberal, and moderate islamist factions, calls for an end to the entrenched 'Le Pouvoir' system. They campaign under the banners of democracy, transparency, and national reconciliation, promising to bring accountability to institutions long dominated by elites. Their coalition appeals to youth, civil society, and disillusioned workers yearning for real change.\n\nThe second bloc is formed of pragmatic independents and technocrats — those seeking reform within the system rather than its destruction. They advocate for gradual democratization, improved governance, and economic liberalization while maintaining stability and security.\n\nAs the ballots are cast and counted, all eyes turn to the results, which could mark either a new dawn for Algeria — or another chapter of cautious transition."

 AlgeriaElections.2.t: "The Elections"
 AlgeriaElections.2.d: "The long-awaited elections have arrived, and the nation holds its breath. The ruling Front de Libération Nationale, or FLN, once again stands as the central pillar of Algeria’s political system — appealing to those who still value stability, unity, and continuity after the turmoil of the Black Decade. Under the leadership of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and the party’s loyal establishment, the FLN promises modernization without chaos, reform without rupture.\n\nOpposition movements, though vocal and diverse, remain divided and fragmented, unable to form a united front capable of challenging the old guard. Many Algerians, weary of upheaval and anxious for order, cast their ballots for the familiar — convinced that experience and security outweigh the risks of change.\n\nAs the final votes are tallied, the outcome becomes clear: the legacy of the revolution still reigns supreme."

The movement’s founder, Abbasi Madani, was sentenced to fifteen years in prison after the June events, during which the army and police violently dispersed thousands of FIS supporters. General Khaled Nezzar ordered Madani’s arrest and imposed a State of Emergency aimed at dismantling the party and suppressing Islamist influence. The crackdown led to chaos, civilian casualties, and the dissolution of any hope for peaceful reform — a spark that ignited the devastating Algerian Civil War, later known as the Black Decade. With Abbasi Madani imprisoned and the FIS leadership scattered, new figures have emerged within the movement. Now, as our influence quietly resurfaces, the question stands — who will lead us through this era of blood and sacrifice toward a new vision for Algeria?"
