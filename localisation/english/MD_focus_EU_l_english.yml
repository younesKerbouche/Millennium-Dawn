 EU_voting_category_desc: "[ROOT.GetFlag] Euroscepticism: [?ROOT.eurosceptic|§%R1]\nEuroscepticism, also known as EU-scepticism, means a criticism of the European Union (EU) and European integration. According to public opinion surveys, this ratio represents the number of people who will likely vote for leaving the European Union in the case of a European Union membership referendum of their country.\n\n[EUU.GetFlag] Europeanism: [?global.var_europeanism|§%G1]\nEuropeanism also known as Pro-Europeanism, sometimes called European Unionism, is a political position that favours European integration and membership of the European Union (EU). It includes the more radical European federalists, who seek to create a single superstate known informally as a United States of Europe. A related term is ’Europhile’. The ratio represents the Europhile people throughout the whole Union.\n\n[ROOT.GetFlag] Breach of values of the European Union: [?ROOT.breach_of_EU_value|§g0]\n\"The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.\"\n- Article 2, Treaty on European Union\n\n"

Many members of the European Parliament are looking for a resolution to the mounting debt in a number of countries in the European Union. The countries have failed to either pay, refinance their governmental debt, or issue emergency funds to failing banks in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. All of the member states in question have reported an inability to repay their debt and have released that their budget deficits were much worse than previously thought. The main commonality amongst the nations is that the root cause of the crisis comes from shifting private debt to national debt through a series of debt bailouts to rescue struggling institutions within the countries. The European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have begun working out deals with the member states to issue relief packages and national bailout programs to prevent a much worse crisis. The one thing that remains clear is that the European Union is on the verge of a cataclysmic crisis, as we stand in the center of the storm that is the Global Financial Crisis. We must remain strong and the Union must reform the Eurozone so we can weather the storm and show the European Union will not falter. Not now, not tomorrow, not ever. In varietate concordia."
