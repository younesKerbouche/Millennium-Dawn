These developments are also geared towards supporting advancements in missile systems, submarines, and other military hardware."
 NKO_Green-Water_Navy: "Green-Water Navy"
 NKO_Green-Water_Navy_desc: "North Korea's development of a green-water navy focuses on extending its operational reach beyond coastal waters to regional seas. This strategy involves deploying small frigates, corvettes, and missile boats, along with efforts to enhance submarine capabilities. The goal is to protect territorial claims, support asymmetric warfare strategies, and project limited power in regional waters, particularly in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. This approach underscores North Korea's ambition to balance cost-effective modernization with its strategic military objectives."

 NKO_Expand_Peasant_Militia: "Expand the Peasant Militia"
 NKO_Expand_Peasant_Militia_desc: "North Korea's expansion of the Peasant Militia, known as the Worker-Peasant Red Guards, is a strategic move to bolster national defense through mass mobilization. This paramilitary force, composed of civilians, is tasked with supplementing regular military operations, defending local communities, and ensuring internal security. Expansion efforts include increased training, equipping militia members with light arms, and integrating them into broader military exercises. This approach reflects North Korea's focus on asymmetric warfare and its \"all-people defense\" strategy, ensuring a large, decentralized force capable of resisting external threats and maintaining domestic stability."

This involves enhancing military training, political education, and physical conditioning for students, often integrating them into national defense exercises. By equipping the Young Red Guards with basic weaponry and survival skills, North Korea ensures a steady pipeline of ideologically committed and combat-ready individuals who can support the regular armed forces in times of conflict. This initiative underscores the regime's reliance on youth mobilization as part of its \"all-people defense\" strategy."
 NKO_Rebuild_sso: "Special Forces Reform"
 NKO_Rebuild_sso_desc: "North Korea's Special Forces reform focuses on modernizing and enhancing the capabilities of its elite units to conduct asymmetric warfare, unconventional operations, and rapid response missions. This reform includes improving training regimens, incorporating advanced tactics, and equipping forces with modern weaponry and communication systems. Special Forces are designed to excel in infiltration, sabotage, reconnaissance, and direct action, often targeting strategic assets or critical infrastructure. The reforms aim to increase their effectiveness in regional conflicts, bolster deterrence, and maintain readiness for a variety of high-stakes missions. This emphasis reflects North Korea's strategic reliance on highly skilled, agile units to offset conventional military limitations."

 NKO_Struggle_for_Power_desc: "The power struggle between Kim Jong-un and his brother, Kim Jong-nam, was a covert battle for succession within North Korea's ruling family. Following their father Kim Jong-il's death, both brothers were potential candidates to lead the regime. Kim Jong-nam, once seen as the favored heir, fell out of favor due to his public criticisms of the regime and his exile in Macau. Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un, supported by influential elites, solidified his position through strategic alliances and internal purges. The struggle ended with Kim Jong-un’s ascension to power in 2011, marked by the mysterious assassination of Kim Jong-nam in 2017, which many believe was orchestrated by the North Korean government. This conflict underscored the ruthless nature of power dynamics in one of the world's most secretive regimes."
