 NIG_nigerian_armed_forces: "Nigerian Armed Forces"
 NIG_nigerian_armed_forces_desc: "The Nigerian Armed Forces rank as the fifth strongest military in Africa, with roots tracing back to the Nigerian Regiment of the Royal West Africa Frontier Force (RWAFF). Today, the military consists of three primary branches: the Nigerian Army, the Nigerian Navy, and the Nigerian Air Force. With a combined strength of approximately 160,000 personnel, Nigeria's military plays a significant role in regional security operations and international peacekeeping missions across the globe, establishing the nation as a key military power in West Africa."
 NIG_defense_industries_of_nigeria: "Defense Industries of Nigeria"
 NIG_defense_industries_of_nigeria_desc: "The Defense Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) represents the cornerstone of Nigeria's military-industrial complex. Established to reduce foreign dependency, this network of state-run facilities produces everything from small arms to ammunition and military vehicles. While still developing, these industries are vital to our national security strategy, creating jobs while building indigenous defense capabilities that will strengthen Nigeria's position as a regional power and reduce our reliance on expensive foreign imports."
 NIG_the_army: "The Army"
 NIG_the_army_desc: "The Nigerian Army has participated in many conflicts in its brief history. From civil war and peacekeeping missions across Africa to counter-insurgency operations against various militant groups, our ground forces have gained valuable combat experience. However, equipment shortages and organizational challenges have limited their effectiveness. By modernizing our command structure, improving training programs, and investing in new equipment, we can transform the Nigerian Army into a professional fighting force capable of defending our sovereignty and contributing to regional stability."
 NIG_air_components: "Air Components"
 NIG_air_components_desc: "The Nigerian Air Force has deteriorated significantly, now consisting of only a handful of helicopters and outdated light aircraft. Our aerial capabilities, once a source of national pride, have been neglected for too long. We must urgently revitalize this critical branch of our armed forces through strategic investments in modern aircraft, training programs, and maintenance facilities. Rebuilding our air power is essential not only for national defense but also for supporting counter-insurgency operations and maintaining Nigeria's position as a regional military power."
 NIG_resource_drives: "Resource Drives"

 NIG_light_submarines: "Anti-Ship Light Submarines"
 NIG_light_submarines_desc: "Light submarines may prove to be beneficial when it comes to anti-piracy operations or local convoy raiding should we ever go to war."
 NIG_corvettes: "Patrol Boats"
 NIG_corvettes_desc: "The Nigerian Navy's strategic focus must be on coastal defense rather than blue-water capabilities. Patrol boats, corvettes, and other light vessels are ideally suited to our maritime security needs, providing cost-effective solutions for anti-piracy operations and territorial protection. These smaller vessels maximize our limited dockyard capacity while offering the maneuverability needed to patrol the Gulf of Guinea and secure our offshore oil infrastructure."
