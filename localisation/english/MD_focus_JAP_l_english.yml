 japan_focus: "Japanese Focus Tree"

 #National Focus
 #Domestic Tree
 JAP_trinity_reform: "Trinity Reform"
 JAP_trinity_reform_desc: "Employment, bureaucracy, education- our fiscal reform must approach all three areas of Japan's vulnerable state with care, or we are doomed to turn the Lost Decade into many more Lost Decades to come."
 #ECONOMICS AND LABOUR
 JAP_large_boned_policy: "Honebuto' Policy"
 JAP_large_boned_policy_desc: "Normally, the Ministry of Finance drafts the national budget based on the ruling party's positions. Some in the LDP are calling for this arrangement to be revised in order to combat the consquences of the Lost Decade, giving the Diet greater influence over what the Ministry of Finance proposes. They are calling this the 'Big-Boned' policy."
 JAP_socialism: "Japanese Socialism"
 JAP_socialism_desc: "The welfare of Japanese citizens cannot end at pensions and healthcare. Childcare and elderly that do not have families to rely on must be covered as well."
 JAP_socialism_TT: "\n§GSocialism will gradually escape deflation by growing the population and decreasing the expectation of social subsidies to satisfy the population. It synergizes well with the Trade Unions internal faction.§!\n§RIt will resolve the depopulation issue quickly, but the effects will take longer to reach the economy.§!\n\n§GThis path favors vertical growth and pacifism.§!"
 JAP_protect_worker_rights: "Protect Workers' Rights"
 JAP_protect_worker_rights_desc: "Tokyo moves to tighten protections for Japan's workforce, strengthening labour standards, oversight of overtime practices and safeguards against exploitation. The reforms promise fairer conditions and greater security for workers, but raise concerns among employers about rising costs and reduced flexibility."
 JAP_union_interest_TT: "§GThis will satisfy the labor unions!§!\n"
 JAP_save_ice_age: "Save the Ice Age Generation!"
 JAP_save_ice_age_desc: "During the Lost Decade, an entire generation of graduates became stranded with no opportunities by a failing economy. The effects of this have been catastrophic, with spiking rates of suicide and a sense of hopelessness among young adults who have given up on society. Some of these fall to despondent, radical thoughts. We must provide hope to the Lost Generation."
 JAP_depopulation_reform_TT: "This will advance our §Gdepopulation reform§!!\n"
 JAP_neoliberalism: "Japanese Neoliberalism"
 JAP_neoliberalism_desc: "We must enrich all Japanese citizens by providing them the opportunity to succeed. To that end, we must help businesses grow. We must not be tempted by easy taxation promises that will strangle our tender economy and impoverish more than ever before."
 JAP_neoliberalism_TT: "\n§GNeoliberalism will quickly escape deflation by boosting the available workforce and reducing staffing needs to immediately fill positions, rather than directly growing the population.§!\n§RIt will later struggle to maintain this level of growth, depending more on social services or foreign puppets to grow its GDP.§!\n\n§GThis path favors aggressive investment and expansionism.§!"
 JAP_deregulate_temporary_staffing: "Deregulate Temporary Staffing"
 JAP_deregulate_temporary_staffing_desc: "Tokyo eases rules on temporary and dispatch work, giving companies more freedom to hire flexible labour through agencies. Business groups hail the move as a way to cut costs and adapt quickly, while unions warn of growing precarity and a weakening of Japan's traditional employment model."
 JAP_national_investments: "Assertive Samurai Bond Investment"
 JAP_national_investments_desc: "Japan enjoys one advantage from its tepid interest rates- it is quite attractive to foreign actors that wish to seek investment from Japanese investors. We could liquidate a few of our unprofitable international investments in order to finance some bond packages with some of our neighbors, which could have a positive effect on our domestic economy."
 JAP_national_investments_TT: "§YIf accepted, we will gain International Investments, influence, and opinion modifiers!§!"
 JAP_intern_training: "Technical Intern Training Program"
 JAP_intern_training_desc: "Expand the Technical Intern Training Program to bring in foreign trainees for sectors struggling with labour shortages, such as manufacturing, agriculture and care work. This focus uses tightly controlled, temporary visas to lower labour pressure at home while officially framing the scheme as skills transfer rather than long-term immigration."
 JAP_liberal_syndicalism: "Trade Union Representatives"
 JAP_liberal_syndicalism_desc: "Reserving some seats in the Diet for representatives of major trade unions would give the unions a direct route to address their concerns to the national assembly and make them more cooperative with political issues. The question is, how much influence do we actually want to give them over elections?"
 JAP_liberal_syndicalism_TT: "§YDepending on the choice, you can replace Industrial Conglomerates with the General Union!§!"
 JAP_labour_management: "Labour Management Director"
 JAP_labour_management_desc: "Appoint a dedicated Labour Management Director to mediate between firms and workers, standardise dispute resolution and monitor compliance with labour law. This focus improves coordination on wages, conditions and restructuring plans across key industries."
 JAP_industrial_union: "Industrial Union"
 JAP_industrial_union_desc: "Restructure fragmented workplace unions into larger, industry-wide organisations that can negotiate sector-level agreements. This focus trades some firm-by-firm flexibility for clearer bargaining frameworks, more consistent wages and stronger representation in key industrial sectors."
 JAP_struggle_high_low: "The Struggle of High and Low"
 JAP_struggle_high_low_desc: "It is too simplistic to blame everything on capitalism, or to dismiss our reforms as communism. Our nation must be unified in spirit, devoted to each other and our respective talents. The worker and the owner, the state and the citizen, each of these cannot exist without the other. We will become one organism, and overcome adversity together."
 JAP_discretionary_labour_laws: "Legislate Discretionary Labour"
 JAP_discretionary_labour_laws_desc: "Discretionary labour allows for an employee's salary to factor potential overtime into a static rate, which enables employers to supervise their employees less. Of course, this method can and has been abused to pressure employees to work more for less pay. We need to make sure it's flexible but fair."
 JAP_subsidy_optimization: "Subsidy Optimization"
 JAP_subsidy_optimization_desc: "One of the largest complaints that small businsses have with applying for subsidies is how top heavy the system feels. For a simple bond or relief package, the noodle stand must fill out the same paperwork meant for Mitsubishi. We will have to dedicate a lot of effort to changing this, but we will remove one of the largest impediments to small businesses."
 JAP_elder_labour: "Shōgai Gen'eki"
 JAP_elder_labour_desc: "Promote the Shōgai Gen'eki ideal of remaining active for life by expanding schemes that keep older citizens in the workforce. This focus encourages firms to rehire retirees, offer flexible hours and adapt workplaces so experienced workers can stay on, easing labour shortages while supporting pension finances."
 JAP_rebuild_lost_generation: "Rebuild the Lost Generation"
 JAP_rebuild_lost_generation_desc: "The shape of labour in Japan is forever changed, and the workforce is finally starting to become comfortable with that fact. Young workers feel that they can balance their work and life, older workers feel valued by their companies and communities. And, we did it without destroying our economy!"
 JAP_universal_child_benefit: "Universal Child Benefit"
 JAP_universal_child_benefit_desc: "Introduce or expand a universal child allowance paid for every child regardless of parental income. This focus shifts resources toward families, helping to cover education and living costs and signalling that the state is serious about supporting childrearing in an aging society."
 JAP_ban_zangyo: "Ban Minashi Zangyō"
 JAP_ban_zangyo_desc: "Karoshi- death by overwork- has been on the rise for several years, as a consequence of a shrinking workforce. We cannot overcome the societal pressure to accept predatory overtime expectations through social change alone, we must leglislate protection that protects workers from their own sense of obligation."
 JAP_nenko_wage: "Reinterpret the Nenko Wage System"
 JAP_nenko_wage_desc: "The old seniority-wage system was flawed in many ways, but its removal has left many retirees who planned around it with insufficient savings that their pensions cannot compensate for. We're ready to change this. We can roll our social reform progress into a new pension, childcare, and unemployment system that protects all Japanese citizens."
 JAP_counter_union: "Cabinet-Led Union Counter-Offensive"
 JAP_counter_union_desc: "Launch a coordinated cabinet effort to curb the rising influence of militant labour unions. This focus strengthens government oversight of industrial action, tightens rules on collective bargaining leverage and backs employers in resisting disruptive strikes, aiming to reassert state authority over wage and workplace disputes."
 JAP_price_escalation: "Controlled Price Escalation"
 JAP_price_escalation_desc: "Businesses are growing the fastest they have in a decade, but we need to prepare for a wave of labour returning to the workforce. We will print enough currency to encourage new construction, but we must capitalize on this burst of growth in order for it to be worth the resulting devaluation of the Yen that will follow!"
 JAP_union_liaison: "Council for Industrial-Union Affairs"
 JAP_union_liaison_desc: "We have dramatically modernized the way labour in Japan functions, and not all aspects of industry have been able to catch up. We need to ensure that the trade union federations and the industrial interests are able to shake hands after so much of society has changed. To do this, we will create a council to coordinate the needs of both."
 JAP_national_minimum_wage: "National Minimum Wage"
 JAP_national_minimum_wage_desc: "Introduce a unified national minimum wage to replace the patchwork of regional standards. This focus lets the government lift the floor under low-paid work, simplify rules for employers and use wage policy as a tool against in-work poverty and stagnant consumption."
 JAP_relaxed_immigration: "Relaxed Immigration"
 JAP_relaxed_immigration_desc: "Loosen immigration rules to make it easier for foreign workers and professionals to settle in Japan. This focus raises visa quotas, simplifies residency paths and accepts more long-term migrants to ease labour shortages and support the tax base."
 JAP_migrant_monitoring: "Migrant Monitoring"
 JAP_migrant_monitoring_desc: "Tighten oversight of foreign residents by expanding registration, workplace inspections and data-sharing between agencies. This focus seeks to reassure the public about immigration controls while keeping closer track of abuse, overstays and illegal employment."
 JAP_improved_naturalization: "Help Foreign Workers"
 JAP_improved_naturalization_desc: "We will reorganize some tax laws and coordinate with several countries we already have visa agreements with so that foreign workers will enjoy more favorable financial conditions while working in Japan, such as streamlining their tax documentation. This does not mean we will commit to more open immigration, but we will make life easier for foreign workers."
 JAP_control_labour_immigrants: "Streamlined Naturalization Process"
 JAP_control_labour_immigrants_desc: "We will standardize a way for foreign nationals seeking permanent residency to accelerate their application. Normally, foreign nationals must reside in Japan for 10 years before earning eligibility for permanent residency. If they speak Japanese fluently and have a stable source of income and career experience, this could be shortened to just 3 years."
 JAP_maternity_tax_reduction: "Expanded Maternity Benefits"
 JAP_maternity_tax_reduction_desc: "Women on maternity leave receive several benefits and compensation already, but we can extend this to fathers taking time off to take care of their family. Additionally, we can subsidize families for each additional child they have. It will be expensive, and reduce our nominal workforce for a time, but the baby boom will pay off."
 JAP_adoption_tax_reduction: "Adoption Tax Reduction"
 JAP_adoption_tax_reduction_desc: "Offer tax reductions and allowances to families who adopt children, including from foster care. This focus supports diverse family structures, eases the financial burden of adoption and helps match children in need with stable households."
 JAP_shine_all_women: "A Society Where All Women Shine"
 JAP_shine_all_women_desc: "Japan must adapt its expectations as a modern society. Men must no longer feel that they are expected to be the sole providers for a family any longer. We must encourage women who are willing to support a family with a full time job. To do this, we must encourage women to seek opportunity- and assure them that they will not be turned away."
 JAP_yamato_nadeshiko: "Yamato Nadeshiko"
 JAP_yamato_nadeshiko_desc: "In order to inspire and motivate women, we must change the way they are viewed by society. They must not be treated as delicate flowers to shun when they reach towards opportunity. Japan cannot remain in the past- we must be willing to let go, even if it means leaving behind a piece of our sentimentality in the past."
 #Government Tree
 JAP_central_government_reform: "Central Government Reform"
 JAP_central_government_reform_desc: "Despite actions to privatize many companies in the 80s and 90s, the bureaucatic system that runs Japan's services is inefficient and, in some cases, prone to corruption. Some voices call for smaller government, other voices just want greater accountability for civil servants. Either choice has its drawbacks and will not be easy to reverse course from."
 JAP_cease_privatization: "Cease Privatisation"
 JAP_cease_privatization_desc: "Suspend ongoing privatisation schemes and keep key assets under direct state control. This focus halts further sell-offs, allowing the government to prioritise public service, employment and long-term stability over short-term revenue gains."
 JAP_cease_privatization_TT: "\n§RThis path increases government expenditure,§! §Gbut makes it easier to intervene in the economy.§!"
 JAP_cease_privatization_TT2: "§YYou can increase the popularity of the ideology you chose!§!"
 JAP_full_independent_audit: "Full Independent Audit"
 JAP_full_independent_audit_desc: "The Kaikeikensain, or Board of Audit, is responsible for reviewing the government's expenditures and comparing them to the budget to ensure finances are being appropriately allocated. Often, submissions to the board are confusing and difficult to read, as the given guidelines are not subject to censure when violated. We will change this, and verify our expenditures are above, at, or below budget."
 JAP_oversight_forum: "Representative Oversight Forum"
 JAP_oversight_forum_desc: "The seats in the Diet should not just be filled with warm bodies. We will put into practice a new system of parliamentary oversight to review the local effects for the laws passed by current and previous administrations. We will collect information through surveys and non-political groups in order to repeal laws that have negatively impacted the people."
 JAP_oversight_forum_TT: "If we complete the focus §LTrade Union Representatives§!, we will receive additional political power!"
 JAP_ombudsman: "National Financial Ombudsman"
 JAP_ombudsman_desc: "Though there are options for citizens to lodge complaints at a local level, the impact of national laws on citizens is largely invisible to the national government. We can create an office designed to process complaints and disputes regarding civil services and ensure these services are reaching everyone."
 JAP_third_agrarian_reform: "Third Agrarian Reform"
 JAP_third_agrarian_reform_desc: "There are many small plots of undesirable, abandoned land that is privately owned but not being exploited for development. Due to the economic effects of the Lost Decade, there is little desire to sell off these lands, and adjacent farmers are unwilling to pay a high price. If we buy these lands at asking price and distribute them to farmers, it will stimulate the land market and increase productivity."
 JAP_continue_privatization: "Continue Privatisation"
 JAP_continue_privatization_desc: "The issue of the postal service's inefficiencies and failures is the final straw in a long list of ways the Japanese bureaucratic system has betrayed the society it is supposed to provide for. We are in a unique position to change the trajectory for Japan's economy, even if the discourse surrounding it splits the party."
 JAP_continue_privatization_TT: "\n§GThis path reduces government expenditure,§! §Rbut makes it harder to intervene in the economy.§!\n\nCompleting this as the conservative wing of the §BLiberal Democratic Party§! will cause the §Yliberal§! wing of the LDP to split off and join the opposition!"
 JAP_service_corporatization: "Civil Service Corporatisation"
 JAP_service_corporatization_desc: "In order to transition more civil services to the private sector, we will put up shares of these formerly nationalised services on the market. This will allow us to sell off our own shares and reduce our debt, but will throw our services into chaos, forcing us to spend more in the short term."
 JAP_corporatization_goal: "Corporatisation Goal"
 JAP_corporatization_goal_desc: "Corporatization of civil services lets the government retain ownership of all shares in the company. This helps with fiscal transparency and market competition, but it doesn't help relieve our tax burden from running these companies when they do poorly. However, it is sensible to keep certain financial and infrastructure companies at this level of ownership."
 JAP_privatization_goal: "Full Privatization Goal"
 JAP_privatization_goal_desc: "Selling all shares of our reorganized service companies to stockholders has benefits beyond the added pressure to profit- we can financially assist them more readily when their market is threatened without as much public objection, as well as tax their revenue when their market is performing well."
 JAP_ldp_fracture_corp_only_TT: "Have not promised to retain some key services as §Ycorporatized§! entities OR §Y[conservatism_L]§! is Not in Power."
 JAP_end_arp: "End 'Gentan' Policy"
 JAP_end_arp_desc: "The Acreage Reduction Policy is the result of a complicated price fixing scheme developed in the 70s. In short, today's large farmers take Gentan subsidies to produce soybeans or other crops in place of rice; in exchange, they limit their production of rice to keep prices high. If we're going to phase out Gentan, we need to decide how we're going to do it."
 JAP_end_arp_tt: "\n§GYou can temporarily increase the productivity of Commercialized Agriculture Districts. Depending on how you repeal the acreage-reduction policy, you’ll be forced to choose between boosting the productivity of Commercialized Agriculture Districts at the cost of political power, or reducing bureaucratic costs!§!"
 JAP_anticorruption_committee: "Accountable Fiscal Reform"
 JAP_anticorruption_committee_desc: "A strong government must have a transparent system of accountability for all officials with the authority to make important decisions. This means more than just a strong audit board, it means close examination of all financial ties, relationships, and promises of officials. If any incident of corruption gets past this barrier, it will be embarrassing and costly for us to clean up."
 JAP_anticorruption_committee_TT: "\n§GThis path will reward us for rejecting corrupt opportunities!§!"
 JAP_digital_archives: "Digital Archives"
 JAP_digital_archives_desc: "Government ministries begin converting paper files, legal records and historical documents into secure digital formats. Centralised databases replace aging storage rooms, allowing administrators, researchers and auditors to access information quickly and trace decisions with far greater clarity."
 JAP_anticorruption_computerization: "Oversight Reduction Policy"
 JAP_anticorruption_computerization_desc: "With a strong emphasis on countering corruption before it takes root, we can make assumptions in our fiscal and personnel policy to make effective reductions in our expenses devoted to policing our bureaucracy. We will only benefit from these optimizations, however, if we maintain a bureaucratic culture that rejects corruption."
 JAP_anticorruption_TT: "Will give §YAccountable Fiscal Reform§! the following bonuses, so long as we maintain §Gnegligible corruption§!:\nPolitical Power Gain: §G+0.25§!\nTax Revenue Multiplier: §G+5.00%§!\nPolice Cost multiplier: §G-30.00%§!"
 JAP_anticorruption_lost_TT: "We will lose the positive effects of the §LAccountable Fiscal Reform§! until we reach §Gnegligible corruption§!."
 JAP_anticorruption_gained_TT: "We will gain the positive effects of the §LAccountable Fiscal Reform§!."
 JAP_countercorruption_law: "Counter-Corruption Law"
 JAP_countercorruption_law_desc: "We cannot possibly create a system that will catch all cases of backdoor dealings that will also be cost effective. Instead of trying to stop corruption before it appears, we should create the framework for a system that rewards those who blow the whistle on illicit activities."
 JAP_countercorruption_law_TT: "\n§GThis path will make it easier for us to recover from corruption!§!"
 JAP_diet_countercorruption: "Kokkai Investigative Powers"
 JAP_diet_countercorruption_desc: "Strengthen Kokkai authority to investigate corruption by expanding committee subpoena powers, tightening testimony requirements and granting broader access to ministry records. Parliamentary hearings are meant to become a serious check on misconduct, putting senior officials and corporate executives under direct scrutiny from elected representatives."
 JAP_iron_triangle: "Crush the Iron Triangle"
 JAP_iron_triangle_desc: "The relationship between bureaucratic officials, businessmen, and politicians has a fatal flaw- the ambition of opposing politicians. We will push to allow the minority government in the Diet to call for special inquiries against the ruling coalition in certain circumstances. This will slow down our government's ability to act, but will make corruption almost trivial to root out by creating an incentive to find it."
 JAP_2nd_government_reform: "Second Central Government Reform"
 JAP_2nd_government_reform_desc: "Creating greater transparency and accountability in our bureaucratic system has helped, but we are left with a tangle of laws that are redundant- and, in some cases, full of loopholes. A second wave of legislation and reform will revitalize our bureaucatic system, reducing costs and trimming unnecessary staffing."
 JAP_anti_revolving: "Destroy Amakudari"
 JAP_anti_revolving_desc: "Introduce strict rules to break the amakudari revolving door between ministries and the companies they regulate. Cooling-off periods are lengthened, post-retirement job approvals are tightened, and senior officials are barred from taking lucrative advisory roles in firms they once oversaw, aiming to loosen the grip of old-boy networks on public policy."
 JAP_government_safeguard: "To Safeguard"
 JAP_government_safeguard_desc: "Government's role is to secure, not provide. We will protect businesses from threats they could not anticipate, but we will not coddle them and reward them for failing to plan ahead. Business shall not guide the hand of policy."
 JAP_legislated_revolving: "Reinterpreted Amakudari"
 JAP_legislated_revolving_desc: "Set out a revised interpretation of amakudari that permits limited post-retirement employment for experienced officials under tighter, legally defined conditions. Clear boundaries on advisory roles, disclosure requirements and approval procedures are introduced to retain valuable expertise without allowing undue influence over former regulatory domains."
 JAP_government_enrich: "To Enrich"
 JAP_government_enrich_desc: "Government's role is to enrich. This extends to business, as well. To do this, we will reinvest corporate taxes back into businesses according to policy agreed upon by both public and private companies and moderated by union leaders. The boundary between public and private is blurred in the 21st century, and we will embrace it!"
 JAP_reacquire_public_corporations: "Expand Public Ownership"
 JAP_reacquire_public_corporations_desc: "Prior privatization measures were intended to reduce the national debt, but the economic slump has not produced the competition needed to materialize the fair prices it was meant to provide. We will buy back enough shares to hold a majority of these companies. It's not an option to allow our most vulnerable people go without affordable rail and telecom."
 JAP_wealth_taxation: "Reorganized Taxation System"
 JAP_wealth_taxation_desc: "The second phase of reacquiring public services is a complete redraft of the taxation system. We have to change how we interact with corporations to cover the cost of reacquiring public services. This will be a difficult road and will harm corporate productivity, but merely trying to grow our way out of debt has not worked for a decade. It's time for a new approach."
 JAP_nationalise_infrastructure: "Nationalize Major Industries"
 JAP_nationalise_infrastructure_desc: "The ultimate goal of state ownership is the central control of all critical infrastructure. This includes transportation networks, telecom, air and sea terminals, resource extraction, and power generation, to name a few. All of these, when managed like a business, can be profitable. Stability is more important than profitability in the 21st century."
 JAP_green_investment: "Payment for Ecosystem Services"
 JAP_green_investment_desc: "State control over infrastructure is a mire of expenses and bureaucracy we do not want to commit to. Instead, our control should nudge infrastructure, resource extraction, and power generation towards sustainable solutions through incentives and subsidies. Ultimately, we hope to see a careful evolution of the economy, not a revolution."
 JAP_redundant: "Redundant Sustainability"
 JAP_redundant_desc: "Japan's vulnerability to natural disasters means that it is also vulnerable to disruptions to the global supply chain. Evolutions in renewable energy will help reduce dependency on unreliable fossil fuels as well as expensive nuclear expansions, as well as protecting our infrastructure through redundant power systems."
 JAP_redundant_TT: "§YYou can choose whether to advance nuclear research further, or take on a mission to phase out nuclear power!§!"
 JAP_e_japan: "e-Japan Initiative"
 JAP_e_japan_desc: "Unveil a national e-Japan strategy that treats high-speed networks and digital services as core infrastructure. Ministries, schools and hospitals are pushed onto broadband platforms, online procedures replace paper counters, and incentives draw private investment into fibre and mobile networks, aiming to make Japan a leading information society rather than a country of fax machines and aging systems."
 JAP_abolish_privilege: "Bureaucratic Privilege Assessment"
 JAP_abolish_privilege_desc: "Some state employees, such as Diet representatives, enjoy special privileges that, in addition to being controversial, are taxing on the budget. Special rent prices, free travel, an excessive allowance on top of their salary. These must be evaluated and adjusted to what is actually necessary to do their job."
 JAP_cut_off_salary: "Cut Bureaucrats' Salaries"
 JAP_cut_off_salary_desc: "Announce a cut in senior bureaucrats' salaries and allowances as a visible gesture of restraint from the top of the state. Pay scales for upper ranks are trimmed, bonuses reduced and certain perks cancelled, sending a signal that officials will share in the sacrifices demanded of taxpayers and frontline workers."
 JAP_bureaucracy_amendment: "Bureaucratic Reform Amendment"
 JAP_bureaucracy_amendment_desc: "New agencies and services added to the budget will require the Diet to come to a fiscal concensus, first. This will create a barrier to new spending that encourages reform over addition. This will increase the trust in our level of taxation, rather than cutting it further."
 JAP_concessional_water_business: "Utilities Privatization"
 JAP_concessional_water_business_desc: "We will go further than just the postal services. Introducing competition to utilities, like water collection and processing, will help provide better service and maintenance to the aging infrastructure that supports it. This will ultimately provide better prices to customers, once factored into the tax relief they will receive."
 JAP_tourism_and_casino: "Tourism and Casino Business"
 JAP_tourism_and_casino_desc: "Gambling in most forms is illegal in Japan. Though this is a socially responsible measure, it means that a lucrative market for tourism is totally closed off. Worse, it encourages illegal gambling, enriching criminal organizations. Legalizing and regulating the gambling market will bring in more revenue, as well as fight crime."
 JAP_private_social_securities: "Social Securities Privatization"
 JAP_private_social_securities_desc: "Complete privatization of social services will require comprehensive reform of the private pensions market. Aside from creating a special company from the Social Insurance Agency, the first step is to open up options for those who want to opt out of the National Pension. This will be expensive at first, but we will save our citizens massive amounts in taxation in the long term."
 #Social Tree
 JAP_mil_sunrise: "Millennium Sunrise"
 JAP_mil_sunrise_desc: "Media, technology, and education are all part of the vastly expanding information spectrum that developed nations depend on. In order to recapture Japan's place at the forefront of the world's research and development, we must reinvigorate all three of these fields out of the scars of the 20th century."
 JAP_mil_sunrise_TT: "§YBy setting a direction for the 21st century, you’ll be able to increase the popularity of any party you choose!§!"
 JAP_dissolve_kisha_club: "Kisha Club Reform"
 JAP_dissolve_kisha_club_desc: "Press clubs are intended to ensure that accredited journalists have easy, immediate access to information direct from sources in companies and the government. In reality, the kisha clubs of Japan shake hands and exchange favors with the entities they are supposed to keep watch over. We need to regulate and diminish the exclusive nature of these associations."
 JAP_domestic_journalism: "Domestic Media Freedom"
 JAP_domestic_journalism_desc: "Large media companies dominate the information space in Japan. Freelancers and small outlets have a difficult time getting access to information before it becomes monopolized by large media conglomerates. After regulating the kisha clubs, we must now go after institutional favoritism."
 JAP_domestic_journalism_TT: "§YYou can choose to push through reforms and gain popularity for the ruling party at the cost of stability, or opt for more modest reforms to gain political power!§!"
 JAP_journalism_solidarity: "Press Freedom Goal"
 JAP_journalism_solidarity_desc: "Ultimately, the goal of press freedom is to nurture a responsible, stable society that can adapt and police itself, regardless of ideology or outlook. We will commit to removing obstructive laws, monetary obstacles, and ultimately tear down the culture of silence that domestic reporters are compelled to submit to."
 JAP_alpha_influencer: "Cultivate Internet Influence"
 JAP_alpha_influencer_desc: "The rise of internet platforms like bloggers and \"Youtubers\" is a serious challenge to conventional media- and, by extension, the stability of information reaching ordinary people. This is the future of information, and we should invest in building a presence for national media on these platforms now."
 JAP_global_journalism: "Global Internet Presence"
 JAP_global_journalism_desc: "Other countries wield national media as a powerful tool for international influence. Classic giants like the BBC and newer contenders like Al-Jazeera have the eyes and ears and- most importantly- minds of millions who live beyond their home country's borders. Japan must seize this emergent form of soft power by expanding funding for NHK-World from a TV channel to a multimedia giant."
 JAP_global_journalism_TT: "§YIf accepted, we will lose §R5B§! in cash per country, but gain §G5B§! in international investment and influence over the accepting country!§!"
 JAP_cultural_export: "Cool Japan Digital Export"
 JAP_cultural_export_desc: "Pour new money into the Cool Japan Fund and push anime studios, game publishers and music labels to chase global streaming audiences. Aniplex and Toei negotiate extra slots on Netflix and Crunchyroll, Sony Music and Avex line up J-pop and idol content for YouTube and TikTok, and VTuber agencies like Hololive and Nijisanji are encouraged to add English and Korean channels. Foreign timelines fill up with Japanese series, clips and livestreams, and tourism ads start riding on the back of every viral opening song and character collab."
 JAP_e_commerce_ease: "E-Commerce Entry Reform"
 JAP_e_commerce_ease_desc: "Lower the barriers for small businesses to enter Japan's major online marketplaces. Rakuten and Yahoo! Shopping simplify registration for new sellers, Amazon Japan expands its fulfilment slots for domestic SMEs, and local governments offer digital onboarding help for rural shops. Family-run bakeries, craft stores and second-hand dealers that once relied on foot traffic can now open nationwide storefronts with a single application."
 JAP_parallel_internet_society: "Parallel Society"
 JAP_parallel_internet_society_desc: "The simple fact is that the internet is a social ecosystem outside of traditional society, and it is a waste of resources to try to force it to conform. We will establish several laws that protect unconventional commentary and anonymity on the internet- in all of its strange, esoteric forms."
 JAP_flexible_copyright: "Adaptive Copyright"
 JAP_flexible_copyright_desc: "Japanese copyright law is extremely strict and, in some ways, unsuited for the internet age. As an example, under current law, there is no provision for a \"fair use\" of material for criticism or discussion. Providing this, among other concessions, would encourage organizations as well as ordinary citizens to draw attention to issues in media."
 JAP_opinion_high_TT: "§YThe higher their opinion of us is, the higher the chance they will accept!§!"
 JAP_freedom_of_internet: "Open Internet Charter"
 JAP_freedom_of_internet_desc: "The cabinet signs an Open Internet Charter that limits how far ministries and police can reach into online speech. Content takedown requests are narrowed to clear crimes, court warrants are required before providers hand over browsing logs, and vague ‘public order' clauses are stripped from telecom rules. Encrypted messaging apps and independent news sites operate with fewer quiet threats in the background, and internet users begin to speak more freely about politics and scandals."

 #depopulation system
 JAP_depopulation_0: "Depopulation Crisis (Contained)"
 JAP_depopulation_0_desc: "We have managed to get the depopulation crisis under control. Families are recovering and birth rates, though not perfect, are improving.\n\nOnce we have also handled the centralization crisis, we can integrate our reforms and optimize how our government manages the demographics issue going forward."
 JAP_depopulation_1: "Depopulation Crisis (Emerging)"
 JAP_depopulation_1_desc: "Our workforce is being crushed from two sides. On one hand, elderly workers are retiring faster than new workers graduate to replace them. On the other hand, young workers' motivation is waning, with many choosing to seclude from society.\n\nLook for reform options under the 'Honebuto' Policy tree to alleviate this crisis. You can use the Demographic Reform focus filter to see all reform options.\n\nYou can also maintain social spending at Welfare State or higher for a small bonus to your current reform progress."
 JAP_depopulation_2: "Depopulation Crisis (Serious)"
 JAP_depopulation_2_desc: "Our birth rate continues to fall. Families are becoming fewer, and unemployed young adults are living at home instead of working. Pensions are a continuous source of debate, and many older workers are fearing for their retirement security.\n\nLook for reform options under the 'Honebuto' Policy tree to alleviate this crisis. You can use the Demographic Reform focus filter to see all reform options.\n\nYou can also maintain social spending at Welfare State or higher for a small bonus to your current reform progress."
 JAP_depopulation_3: "Depopulation Crisis (Severe)"
 JAP_depopulation_3_desc: "We are seeing severe consequences of a shrinking workforce, with many companies struggling to fill positions while unemployment skyrockets. Incidents of death from overwork among white collar workers is rising at an alarming rate, and to accompany this trend there are many more adults disengaging from society and becoming modern hermits. The social security system is overwhelmed, and this is cutting into the amount that can be paid out in pensions.\n\nLook for reform options under the 'Honebuto' Policy tree to alleviate this crisis. You can use the Demographic Reform focus filter to see all reform options.\n\nYou can also maintain social spending at Welfare State or higher for a small bonus to your current reform progress."
 JAP_depopulation_4: "Depopulation Crisis (Out of Control)"
 JAP_depopulation_4_desc: "In Tokyo, trains are delayed daily due to 'human accidents'. Conductors have entered a collective anesthesia, their minds numbed by scale of trauma that awaits them on the tracks. Cultural attitude towards this epidemic has swung from tolerance, to concern, and now solemnly sits at apathy.\n\nLook for reform options under the 'Honebuto' Policy tree to alleviate this crisis. You can use the Demographic Reform focus filter to see all reform options.\n\nYou can also maintain social spending at Welfare State or higher for a small bonus to your current reform progress."
 JAP_demographics_finished: "Resolved Demographic Issue"
 JAP_demographics_finished_desc: "The scars of the Lost Decade are evident on Japan still, but we have adapted and we have overcome. Our unified reform plans have boosted productivity and found ways to deal with the 'uniquely Japanese' consequences of the demographic crisis of the 21st century."
 #Start Debuff
 JAP_bubble_burst: "Heisei Bubble Aftermath"
 JAP_bubble_burst_desc: "Japan is still shaped by the deflated asset bubble of the early 1990s. Land prices remain far below their peak, banks carry long memories of bad loans, and companies prefer hoarding cash over risky investment. The slow-growth habits formed during the Heisei recession continue to guide business decisions and government policy alike."
 JAP_authorities_poor: "Weak Oversight Authorities"
 JAP_authorities_poor_desc: "Japan's watchdog agencies are fragmented and underpowered. Audit bodies lack staff, regulators rely on voluntary reports, and serious complaints often vanish into jurisdictional gaps between ministries and commissions."
 #economic tree
 JAP_welfare_reform_bad: "Strained Welfare Reform"
 JAP_welfare_reform_bad_desc: "Japan's welfare system is stuck in a difficult transition. Eligibility checks have tightened, benefits lag behind living costs, and local offices struggle to process rising numbers of elderly and low-income cases. Public trust erodes as reforms meant to stabilise the system instead leave many households feeling exposed."
 JAP_peoples_lives_first: "People's Lives First"
 JAP_peoples_lives_first_desc: "Budget choices and cabinet messaging put everyday living standards ahead of abstract fiscal targets. Increases in pensions, child benefits and medical subsidies are protected even when other programmes are trimmed, and ministries are told to justify policies in terms of wages, rent and household bills rather than macroeconomic charts."
 JAP_one_nation: "New Japanese Office"
 JAP_one_nation_desc: "The office is a temple, not a cage. It must be a place of focus and calm, it must be a place where the manager and worker are one mind unified towards a task. This temple, like these home islands, is the spiritual home where knowledge is applied into productivity."
 JAP_worker_relief: "Worker Relief Measures"
 JAP_worker_relief_desc: "Extra relief measures cushion workers facing low wages and unstable contracts. Expanded housing aid, retraining subsidies and emergency loans keep many households afloat, buying time for people caught between rising living costs and uncertain employment."
 JAP_keidanren_influence: "Keidanren Influence"
 JAP_keidanren_influence_desc: "Big business, organised through Keidanren, holds a strong voice in policymaking. Tax, trade and labour proposals are routinely run past its committees first, and cabinet ministers treat its policy papers as informal guidelines for Japan's economic course."
 JAP_work_style_reform: "Work Style Reform Drive"
 JAP_work_style_reform_desc: "Work style reform is reshaping offices and factories. Legal caps on overtime are in force, telework rules are being tested, and companies are pushed to convert some non-regular staff to regular contracts, even as old habits of long hours and face time remain hard to break."
 JAP_legislated_flexibility: "Legislated Labour Flexibility"
 JAP_legislated_flexibility_desc: "Labour law now leans toward flexibility. Discretionary and performance-based contracts are easier to use, fixed-term and part-time arrangements are more common, and firms can adjust staffing more quickly—at the cost of weaker job security for many workers."
 JAP_abenomics: "Three Arrows of Abenomics"
 JAP_abenomics_desc: "Economic policy is organised around Abenomics' three arrows: aggressive monetary easing, flexible fiscal spending and structural reform. The Bank of Japan keeps rates ultra-low, public works and subsidies support demand, and ministries push gradual deregulation in selected sectors."
 JAP_immigration1: "Relaxed Immigration"
 JAP_immigration1_desc: "Immigration rules are looser than in the past. Work and study visas are easier to obtain and renew, more long-term residents settle in Japanese cities, and foreign neighbourhoods around major stations are becoming a normal part of urban life."
 JAP_immigration2: "Surveilled Relaxed Immigration"
 JAP_immigration2_desc: "Immigration is more open on paper but tightly watched in practice. Foreign workers and residents face frequent ID checks, detailed address registration and expanded data sharing between ministries, keeping numbers up while maintaining a constant sense of surveillance."
 JAP_foreign_worker_legislation1: "Foreign Workers Framework"
 JAP_foreign_worker_legislation1_desc: "A dedicated legal framework now governs foreign workers. Quotas, skill categories and employer obligations are clearly defined, allowing factories, farms and care homes to rely on overseas labour without improvising around old trainee schemes."
 JAP_foreign_worker_legislation2: "Naturalisation-Oriented Worker Policy"
 JAP_foreign_worker_legislation2_desc: "Foreign workers follow clearer paths from temporary status to permanent residency and citizenship. Long-term contributors gain easier access to social insurance, family reunification and naturalisation, and some neighbourhoods now see second-generation residents who speak Japanese as their first language."
 JAP_japanese_equality: "Japanese Equality Norm"
 JAP_japanese_equality_desc: "Public debate treats full social participation by women, LGBTQ people and minorities as a mainstream expectation rather than a fringe demand. Anti-discrimination language appears in more company rules and local ordinances, and open prejudice draws louder pushback than in previous decades."
 JAP_temp_staff: "Temporary Staffing Breakthrough"
 JAP_temp_staff_desc: "Temporary staffing agencies have become a central pillar of Japan's labour market. Offices, factories and call centres rely heavily on dispatched workers whose contracts can be renewed or dropped with little notice, giving employers agility but entrenching a two-tier workforce."
 JAP_motivated_feminism: "Motivated Feminism"
 JAP_motivated_feminism_desc: "A motivated feminist current shapes politics and workplaces. Lawsuits over harassment and pay gaps move through the courts, women's groups track statistics on board seats and promotions, and companies with visibly male-only leadership face growing public criticism."
 JAP_artificial_growth: "Artificial Growth Policies"
 JAP_artificial_growth_desc: "Economic expansion rests heavily on government and central bank support. Ultra-low interest rates, stimulus spending and targeted subsidies keep GDP figures in positive territory, even as underlying productivity and demographics would point toward stagnation without constant intervention."
 JAP_subsidy_baby_boom: "Baby Boom Subsidy Push"
 JAP_subsidy_baby_boom_desc: "Generous child allowances, tuition support and childcare subsidies are in place to push back against falling birth rates. Young couples see more financial help with pregnancy, nursery fees and schooling, and local governments compete with bonus payments to attract families."
 JAP_adoption_wave: "Adoption Wave"
 JAP_adoption_wave_desc: "Domestic adoption is quietly rising. More couples choose to take in children from foster care, prefectures run active matching programmes, and courts process cases faster, giving otherwise institutionalised children a realistic path into family life."
 #Government Tree
 JAP_authorities_changing: "Reorganised Oversight Authorities"
 JAP_authorities_changing_desc: "Oversight agencies are in the middle of reorganisation. Old commissions are being merged or rebranded, mandates are rewritten, and staff move between offices while new procedures bed in, leaving supervision uneven from sector to sector."
 JAP_authorities_good: "Effective Oversight Authorities"
 JAP_authorities_good_desc: "Independent watchdogs and regulators are able to check ministries and major corporations with real authority. Audit reports are published, fines bite, and agencies have enough staff and legal tools to make misconduct materially risky."
 JAP_bureau_ombudsman: "Bureaucratic Ombudsman Office"
 JAP_bureau_ombudsman_desc: "Citizens and civil servants can bring complaints about administrative abuse to an ombudsman office outside the normal hierarchy. Patterns of misconduct inside ministries are tracked across cases, and well-documented findings are difficult for senior officials to ignore."
 JAP_bureau_forum: "National Forum for Policy Review"
 JAP_bureau_forum_desc: "The Diet must meet more often to discuss complaints from citizens and small businesses, raising the expected salary of representatives."
 JAP_agriculture_land: "Regulated Farmland Ownership"
 JAP_agriculture_land_desc: "Farmland remains tightly regulated. Local committees must approve transfers, non-farm corporations face strict limits on direct ownership, and the patchwork of small family plots still shapes how rural Japan looks and farms."
 JAP_agriculture_free1: "Liberalised Farmland Market"
 JAP_agriculture_free1_desc: "Farmland rules have been loosened. Corporate operators can lease or buy larger areas more easily, and smallholders who wish to exit the sector find fewer legal obstacles when selling or consolidating their plots."
 JAP_agriculture_free2: "Open Agricultural Land Market"
 JAP_agriculture_free2_desc: "Farmland is now treated largely as a normal asset market. Big agribusinesses and investors can acquire large tracts with minimal restriction, accelerating consolidation into industrial-scale farms while traditional village patterns break up."
 JAP_accountability_flexible1: "Counter-Corruption Law"
 JAP_accountability_flexible1_desc: "Secret deals and sketchy allocation of funds will not go unnoticed. Guarantees for whistleblowers and incentives for the press make for a frustratingly scrutinized political environment... that's a good thing, right?"
 JAP_accountability_flexible2: "Enhanced Counter-Corruption Law"
 JAP_accountability_flexible2_desc: "We have a robust system of investigatory measures that make it hard to push our laws through without scrutiny, but it’s even harder to sneak secret business deals through without being caught and punished."
 JAP_service_shocks: "Civil Service Privatization Shocks"
 JAP_service_shocks_desc: "We must simultaneously operate and sell off formerly nationalised services, like Japan Post. This is a cumbersome process that will take time."
 JAP_privatization_corp: "Corporatised Public Services"
 JAP_privatization_corp_desc: "Many state functions are now delivered by semi-independent public corporations. Agencies modelled on firms handle rail, utilities and logistics under performance contracts, blurring the line between administration and business while keeping formal ownership in government hands."
 JAP_privatization_full: "Full-Scale Privatisation"
 JAP_privatization_full_desc: "Large parts of Japan's infrastructure and services have been handed to private owners. Rail lines, utilities and logistics hubs operate for profit under regulatory oversight, and ministries steer outcomes mainly through contracts and rulebooks instead of direct management."
 JAP_nationalized_infrastructure1: "Nationalised Core Infrastructure"
 JAP_nationalized_infrastructure1_desc: "Key transport and energy networks have been brought back under state ownership. Major rail corridors and at least one leading power utility now follow government investment plans and service obligations instead of shareholder priorities."
 JAP_green_energy: "Green Energy Transition"
 JAP_green_energy_desc: "Japan is shifting steadily toward renewable energy. Offshore wind farms, solar arrays and upgraded grid links expand each year, and utilities adjust their portfolios away from older coal and oil plants toward lower-carbon sources."
 JAP_bureaucratic_austerity1: "Compression of Senior Bureaucrats’ Salaries"
 JAP_bureaucratic_austerity1_desc: "We have trimmed the pay scale for senior bureaucrats, reduced bonuses and allowances, and abolished certain perks. This eases the fiscal burden, but it will inevitably cast a shadow over bureaucratic morale and political cohesion."
 JAP_bureaucratic_austerity2: "Reform-First Fiscal Agreement"
 JAP_bureaucratic_austerity2_desc: "New spending cannot move forward without a fiscal agreement in parliament. As a result, “reform” advances over “additions,” lowering administrative costs. Instead of cutting the tax burden, public acceptance of the current tax system increases, and tax revenues grow."
 JAP_government_role_libertarian: "Government's Purpose: Defense"
 JAP_government_role_libertarian_desc: "The government’s role is not to hand out benefits. It is to protect. We will shield businesses from threats no one could have foreseen—but we have no intention of footing the bill for negligence. Failure will not be rewarded. The helm of the state is held by the government, not by corporations."
 JAP_government_role_social: "Government's Purpose: Enrichment"
 JAP_government_role_social_desc: "Taxes are not meant to take—they are meant to grow. Based on an agreement between public and private actors, corporate taxes are returned to the front lines as investment, with labor union leadership coordinating their allocation. In an age where the line between public and private has blurred, we raise “enrichment” as the purpose of the state."
 JAP_free_market1: "Japanese Free Market"
 JAP_free_market1_desc: "We open areas long handled by the state to the market, placing competition and choice at the heart of the system. The government steps back from direct operation, narrowing its role to “setting the framework” and “providing a minimum safety net.” Short-term friction is unavoidable, but in the long run it promises lighter burdens and greater efficiency."
 JAP_tourism_boom: "Explosion of Tourism Industry"
 JAP_tourism_boom_desc: "Rather than driving gambling underground, we drag it into the light. By legalizing casinos and turning them into a tourism revenue stream through regulation and taxation, we also increase the burden of policing and oversight—and social backlash is inevitable. Amid the turmoil, the voices calling for “order” grow louder."
 #Social Tree
 JAP_media_domestic: "Domestic Media Focus"
 JAP_media_domestic_desc: "Freedom of the press is not for any particular ideology, but so society can keep correcting itself. We will remove obstructive legal and financial barriers and break the atmosphere that forces domestic journalists into silence. Politics will no longer move lightly, but the public will regain its composure—and when what must be protected is threatened, they will rally together more strongly."
 JAP_media_foreign: "Foreign Media Focus"
 JAP_media_foreign_desc: "FWe rearm Cool Japan as an “export industry.” We push anime, games, music, and VTubers onto global streaming platforms, flooding overseas timelines with Japan-made content. Views and hype shape public opinion, carrying Japan’s presence further and faster than words ever could."
 JAP_internet_freedom: "Internet Freedom"

 JAP_internet_watchdog_desc: "National internet infrastructure is carefully controlled, allowing for monitoring of digital traffic anywhere in the JP subnet. Anyone looking up how to produce certain chemicals will find their net traffic scrutinized."
 JAP_telecom_investments: "Japanese Telecom Investments"
 JAP_telecom_investments_desc: "Additional investment from abroad accelerates the modernization and integration of our telecommunications infrastructure. As networks and equipment come into place, our messaging can reach farther—and more reliably. And as the reach of our words and images expands, Japan’s presence grows stronger with it."
 JAP_website_boom: "Entrepreneurial Website Boom"
 JAP_website_boom_desc: "We lower the barriers to entering online marketplaces, unleashing commerce nationwide with “a single application.” Family-run shops and small local businesses ride the wave of e-commerce to expand, and capital and talent begin to converge. The momentum of growth boosts tax receipts and productivity, but the speed of change can easily throw society out of step."
 JAP_website_crackdown: "Illicit Web Crackdown"
 JAP_website_crackdown_desc: "We tighten the gateway to .jp, making the back end of hosting and domains visible. With strict identity verification, comprehensive record-keeping, and rapid takedown compliance, we narrow the escape routes for illicit networks. Intelligence agencies shift from “chasing” to “containing,” and the hand of governance reaches further—and faster."

 JAP_science_objective_broad: "Interdisciplinary Science"
 JAP_science_objective_broad_desc: "The value of science cannot be measured in short-term returns. We provide researchers and students with grants that let them iterate without interruption, supporting inquiry that is not driven by contracts or convenience. As collaboration across disciplinary boundaries grows, the pace of discovery accelerates."
 JAP_science_objective_money: "Commercialism in Science"
 JAP_science_objective_money_desc: "Instead of scattering grants, we drive research through contracts. National research institutes take on private-sector R&D projects, concentrating resources on topics where results are demanded. Research moves toward where it will be used, and technology returns to the state in the form of revenue and taxes."
 JAP_research_emphasis_lean: "Lean Research Funding"

 JAP_supportive_society: "Supportive Society"
 JAP_supportive_society_desc: "Simply invoking “personal responsibility” cannot heal the wounds left by the Lost Decade.

 Japan.100001001.d: "We have committed our reform to reserving seats in the Diet for elected trade union representatives, but we must decide how much influence we actually want to give them. Since we have already satisfied the unions with this move, there is no risk of agitating them if we keep the number of seats reserved for them modest and unlikely to shake up an election.\n\nHowever, if we are confident we can leverage the unions' influence in our favor, it may be worth providing for more seats than we initially offered."
 Japan.100001001.oA: "A token amount."
 Japan.100001001.oB: "They cannot be ignored."
 Japan.100002000.t: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] Offers a Samurai Bond Deal"
 Japan.100002000.d: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] is interested in offering us an investment deal in order to help stimulate their domestic economy.\n\nWe will issue Yen-denominated bonds valued at $30b and these will be bought by [FROM.GetAdjectiveCap] investors to finance our interests at home. Given [FROM.GetNameWithFlag]'s exceptionally low interest rates due to their economic situation, this won't add to our national debt at all.\n\n[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] will gain a negligible amount of influence from this."
 Japan.100002000.oA: "Accept The Deal"
 Japan.100002000.oB: "Refuse The Deal"
 Japan.100002001.t: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] Accepts the Deal!"
 Japan.100002001.d: "Officials from [FROM.GetNameWithFlag] have agreed to issue a bond package worth $30b in order to finance [FROM.GetAdjectiveCap] development companies seeking investment capital. The reliable yet modest margins offered by these bonds have our domestic investors eager to take advantage of this deal, and we comfortably predict a 100% demand for the whole package!"
 Japan.100002001.oA: "Excellent."
 Japan.100002002.t: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] Refuses the Deal"
 Japan.100002002.d: "Unfortunately, officials from [FROM.GetName] have declined our offer for a bond package. This shouldn't cause any economic consequences at home, but we will miss out on the possible investment income."
 Japan.100002002.oA: "Unfortunate."
 Japan.100002101.t: "An Empress on the Throne?"
 Japan.100002101.d: "With the birth of Prince Hisahito, the immediacy of the succession debate has been pushed back. However, the question remains strong in the Japanese public consciousness. Conservative voices want to retain a male-only succesion line, as has been historical precedent. However, this is no longer a popular position that the public supports. We must at least open the door for future possibilities for female succession.\n\nIf not for Prince Hisahito's birth, this would mean that Princess Aiko would have the next legitmate claim, following Prince Naruhito.\n\nThe real question is, with Hisahito born and a Empress on the Chrysanthemum Throne an open possibility for the future, should the youngest addition to the Imperial Family retain his position at the expense of a princess with more immediate claim to the Throne?"
 Japan.100002101.oA: "Let's not dig that up, now."
 Japan.100002101.oB: "In the interest of equality, no!"

 Japan.100003000.t: "Argument over Privatization Debate"
 Japan.100003000.d: "The Diet is bubbling with discussion over the decision to cease any further privatization of national companies. This comes at the end of much deliberation within the LDP over the fate of the postal service, and the culmination of the discussion has left the LDP split. Various parties are trying to take credit for this upset, each respectively citing their argmuents as being the decisive factor in the ultimate withdrawal from further attempts to open up what remains of the Japanese nationalised services to the free market.\n\nArguments continue, but the real question is, who caught the most attention from the public?"
 Japan.100003000.oA: "The Conservatives."
 Japan.100003000.oB: "The Liberals."
 Japan.100003000.oC: "The Socialists."
 Japan.100003000.oD: "The Nationalists."
 Japan.100003010.t: "Acreage Reduction Policy Phase-out"
 Japan.100003010.d: "Until the Food Control System was abolished in 1995, the rice market in Japan had been controlled by the government. This practice, started during the Second World War but having feudal roots, had been intended to guarantee a fixed reserve of rice as a national security measure. However, since farms would sell all of their rice to the government, they had an incentive to produce as much as possible. 'Gentan' policy refers to a range of subsidies that originated in the 70s, intended to keep prices of rice high, and thus keep the crop profitable. Essentially, it was cheaper for the government to pay farmers a subsidy to limit their acreage of planted rice crop rather than find a way to be rid of surplus rice.\n\nIt is now [GetYear], and the subsidies are a non-insignificant source of government expenditure. Without the Food Control System, maintaining Gentan policy no longer makes sense, but many large farmers depend on the high prices it artificially creates.\n\nWe need to decide how to support the farmers. Do we hand out a final wave of adjusted subsidies over the next three years? Or do we offer a predicted lump sum compensation?"
 Japan.100003010.oA: "Phase it out."
 Japan.100003010.oB: "Tear the plaster off."
 Japan.100003110.t: "Audit Finds Excess Expenditures!"
 Japan.100003110.d: "As part of our reforms to the Board of Audit, we have submitted an expense report following the new, stricter guidelines. The board has found that there are a few programs that have run over budget. Though this means we will need to authorize an extension to the budget to balance the difference, this discovery has had a positive effect on how the public sees our reform efforts. This makes the [Root.GetRulingParty] appear committed to holding itself accountable."
 Japan.100003110.oA: "Well, it's not all bad!"
 Japan.100003111.t: "Audit Finds Budget Discrepancy!"
 Japan.100003111.d: "As part of our reforms to the Board of Audit, we have submitted an expense report following the new, stricter guidelines. The board has found there is an unspent sum of finances that does not align with the total expenditures, which could indicate something suspicious. An investigation has been demanded in order to determine the cause of the discrepancy.\n\nIf something is found that implicates the opposition, we can reap the benefits, having initiated the audit reform. Of course, there is the possibility that some of our own party members could be involved in something embarrassing, as well..."
 Japan.100003111.oA: "The opposition failed to disclose campaign finances!"
 Japan.100003111.oB: "Our cabinet overpaid a subsidy!"
 Japan.100003112.t: "Audit Finds Budget On Target!"
 Japan.100003112.d: "As part of our reforms to the Board of Audit, we have submitted an expense report following the new, stricter guidelines. The board has found all of our government's expenditures line up with the budget for this year. We have succeeded in establishing greater fiscal transparency, and we can put a bit more presusre on our political partners as a consequence."
 Japan.100003112.oA: "Fantastic."
 Japan.100003200.t: "Schism in the LDP!"
 Japan.100003200.d: "Committing to continued privatization of state services has caused a fracture in the Liberal Democratic Party! Though we have seen this confrontation coming, the scale of the exodus from the party was not. A moderate amount of representatives are going over to the Democratic Party of Japan, and a few are moving away from our Western-oriented approach to globalized economics in protest, which we expected, and we have no real way to prevent that fact.\n\nHowever, a large group are debating joining a competing conservative group, the New Conservative Party. An opposing conservative block in the opposition would torpedo any chance we have of winning any elections in the future! We've devised a plan to appeal to this contingent of deserters with promises of a market-driven analysis of the private sector for the state services we're replacing, even though we already intended to do this as part of our approach. This would restrict our ability to operate as we wish for the future, though, but it's better than a vote of no confidence!"
 Japan.100003200.oA: "Wait! Keep some critical services fully owned by the state..."
 Japan.100003200.oB: "We'll win back the house without you!"
 JAP_ldp_fracture_TT: "We will be compelled to leave major institutions §Ycorporatized§! later, instead of full privatization!"
 Japan.100003400.t: "Corruption Slips Past Oversight!"
 Japan.100003400.d: "The digitization of our bureaucratic oversight committee has allowed for a significant reduction in administrative costs, but this has only been possible because of trust in the system to catch and alert the committee to suspicious actions. A scandal has broken that an official used trusted knowledge of the Digital Personnel Management database to evade automatic detection of some underhanded dealings. This has shaken confidence in the system and, until we can patch up the loopholes that allowed this, we won't see any benefits of the automation, but we will feel all of the costs!"
 Japan.100003400.oA: "Damn!"
 Japan.100003401.t: "Corruption Nailed Down!"
 Japan.100003401.d: "The technicians responsible for automating the Digital Personnel Management software have reported that the system has been updated to account for the most recent, high profile patterns of suspicious activity. We can comfortably say any future loopholes trying to slip bribery, deals, or other forms of corruption 'under the radar', so to speak, are accounted for."
 Japan.100003401.oA: "Let's hope."
 Japan.100003500.t: "The Green Atom?"
 Japan.100003500.d: "As discussions continue about reducing our fossil fuel dependency, there is a question that Japan must address. Japan's history with the atom is a scarred one, and although opposition to nuclear energy is a minority today, the debate over the future energy plan for a green Japan has brought the discussion back into the forefront.\n\nThough the nuclear energy of today is generally very safe, Japan is very seismically vulnerable. This also extends to its nuclear power stations and spent fuel cooling sites. A once in a millennium disaster could, one day, cause enough damage to cause a release of nuclear material.\n\nThe truth is, today, Japan would not be able to support its electrical grid without nuclear power. However, if we were to commit to a phase-out of our nuclear energy over the next 5 years, we could shift our research grants away from nuclear research and into more generally applicable electrical technology. This would yield huge bonuses to our overall electrical grid."
 Japan.100003500.oA: "No. We need nuclear energy. Period."
 Japan.100003500.oB: "Let's do it."
 #Social Tree
 Japan.100004000.t: "The Wounded Phoenix"
 Japan.100004000.d: "After the devastation of the Second World War, Japan not only overcame the turbulence of political instability that followed, but developed into an economic giant that even briefly overtook the United States' GDP.\n\nOf course, this didn't last. Following a period of catastrophic recession, Japan's economy may have stabilized yet its society has not. The scars of the economic crash have isolated an entire generation, and the traditional stability that Japan has taken for granted is no longer so certain. There are many politicians that have been waiting for an opening to pry open the conservative grip on Japanese politics, and there are many disenfranchised voters who will take a chance with these promises rather than let stagnation keep the helm."
 Japan.100004000.oA: "Policies change, but Japan does not."
 Japan.100004000.oB: "It's time to shake things up..."
 Japan.100004000.oC: "... a lot. We'll replace the whole system..."
 Japan.100004000.oD: "... with something familiar."
 Japan.100004009.t: "NHK World: Dispatch of the Proposal to Expand International Streaming"
 Japan.100004009.d: "To strengthen Japan’s international information outreach, we will establish NHK World, NHK’s international public broadcasting channel, and, in addition to television broadcasting, also roll out a global online video service including live streaming.\n\nFor stable video distribution, the telecommunications environment on the recipient country’s side is crucial. Therefore, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will offer to support the upgrading of internet technology—such as increasing line capacity, improving relay infrastructure, and optimizing distribution—in order to sustain the bandwidth required for live streaming. In return, the proposal requests that the proposing country’s internet service providers grant “zero-rating” preferential treatment to NHK World’s traffic, excluding the site’s data usage from users’ data caps.\n\nWill this proposal be accepted?"
 Japan.100004009.oA: "Send the proposal."
 Japan.100004010.t: "Foundation of NHK World"
 Japan.100004010.d: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] has established an international channel of its public broadcasting service, NHK. This alone is not newsworthy- what is unusual is what Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is offering. Rather than solely provide NHK World as a television channel, they are eager to introduce an internet video service worldwide.\n\nThey are offering to help provide technological upgrades to our internet technology in order to support the bandwidth needed for live video service. In exchange, our internet service providers will guarantee \"zero rating\" preference for NHK World's bandwidth, which exempts the website's data usage from user's data allowances.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 Japan.100004010.oA: "Let's do it."
 Japan.100004010.oB: "Terrible idea."
 Japan.100004011.t: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] Accepts Internet Development"
 Japan.100004011.d: "As part of our negotations with [FROM.GetNameWithFlag] over the development of their internet technology, they have agreed to ensure that their ISPs will provide favorable data plans to their users accessing NHK World online.\n\nIf we wanted to take this partnership further, we could provide investments in their telecom infrastructure."
 Japan.100004011.oA: "Let's just keep it cordial."
 Japan.100004011.oB: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] could use some better infrastructure, actually!"
 Japan.100004012.t: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] Provides Additional Investments"
 Japan.100004012.d: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] is pleased that we have accepted the telecom technology deal, and have invested some additional resources to help update our telecom infrastructure. This should be helpful once we finish integrating our internet technology and are ready to install the new infrastructure."
 Japan.100004012.oA: "Nice."
 Japan.100004020.t: "Patent Agreement with China?"
 Japan.100004020.d: "With us relaxing our copyright protections to better suit the digital age, there is one loophole that we must close. [CHI.GetNameWithFlag] has often ignored foreign intellectual property rights, and does little to punish patent theft by its national companies.\n\nMajor Japanese business interests have proposed that we tackle the situation directly by appealing to Chinese interests. The proposed deal is to share some of the industrial patents that the Chinese would otherwise just steal, and in exchange provide favorable deals for our industrial resource procurement, allowing us to forward some of our required production resources through Chinese subsidiaries.\n\nThis isn't without risk, however. The Chinese are fickle, and always looking for an opportunity to embarrass us- even when it means throwing out a good deal. Should we go for it?"
 Japan.100004020.oA: "Let's try it."
 Japan.100004020.oB: "A waste of time."
 Japan.100004021.t: "Sino-Japanese Patent Agreement"
 Japan.100004021.d: "[JAP.GetNameWithFlag] has approached us with an offer to try to remedy some of the conflicts we have over intellectual property rights. Up front, they want us to hold our companies responsible for patent violations that copy Japanese construction and industrial technology. In exchange, they are offering to use this agreement as a commercial line of cooperation to provide us with industrial technology.\n\nIf we accept this outright, we will undoubtedly face criticism for openly submitting to conditions for us to develop our economy, even if the deal might help us gain this technology quicker. What should we do?"
 Japan.100004021.oA: "We'll see what they can offer."
 Japan.100004021.oB: "This is an attack on our sovereignty!"
 Japan.100004022.t: "China Accepts!"
 Japan.100004022.d: "Surprisingly, [CHI.GetNameWithFlag] has agreed to cooperate with our patent protection agreement, in exchange for modest technical assistance with developing their economy. This is a great deal for us, as we can use this agreement to gain a favorable exchange on resource imports whenever scarcity might otherwise hinder our production."
 Japan.100004022.oA: "Good."
 Japan.100004023.t: "China Refuses!"
 Japan.100004023.d: "[CHI.GetNameWithFlag] has refused to cooperate with us! Despite us reaching out to them with favorable terms, they think themselves above our technical assistance. The opposition is criticizing our approach, and we are worse off than had we just not bothered to reach out to the ingrates!"
 Japan.100004023.oA: "Shameful!"
 Japan.100004030.t: "Media Shakeup!"
 Japan.100004030.d: "Recent policy changes have sent shockwaves through the country, as established Japanese news companies scramble to adapt to new laws limiting how restrictive companies may be in providing press coverage to smaller news outlets. The broadening market has allowed many smaller news outlets, including independent journalists, to seize the opportunity to capitalize on stories with higher quality and more diverse coverage.\n\nThe greatest impact has yet to come, as ratings continue to plummet for the largest news conglomerates."
 Japan.100004030.oA: "As it should be."
 Japan.100004030.oB: "We should... maybe dial back those reforms a bit..."
 Japan.100004100.t: "Research Policy Reform"
 Japan.100004100.d: "As we reorganize our national research laboratories to fit the 21st century, we need to decide how to fund them. It isn't a simple matter of putting more money in and getting an equal return of scientific advances back, however. We need to decide how much of our budget should be devoted to research and development.\n\nMany are advocating that we reduce the scale of national laboratories and use the money gained to finance private research in its place. Others want to simply optimize the spending and excessive expenditures of RIKEN without contraction or expansion of its scale.\n\nAnd there are, of course, others that advocate for expanded research, far beyond what most countries would be willing to commit to..."
 Japan.100004100.oA: "Streamline a leaner research administration."

 Japan.100004101.t: "In Pursuit of Excellence..."
 Japan.100004101.d: "It is an expensive path to take, but we have committed to a heavy degree of public funding for research, far more than most countries are willing to burden their expenditures with. With how we stand currently, this already provides some challenges and inefficiencies that we won't be able to overcome just by throwing more money at it.\n\nHowever, some adventurous minds are suggesting we go even further, massively expanding our funding and the size of national laboratories. We would be stealing brains from private industry, most certainly, but we can more directly guide their research if they are on a public payroll. Of course, this is not something we can easily back down from. We need to choose to focus on civilian or defense technologies, if we do this. Unless we're willing to accept an enormous amount of waste just for a bit of an edge over the globe..."

 Japan.100004110.d: "We have many research associates that want to undertake advanced experiments with next-generation software. We can't lavish with funds every strange idea they come up with, but we can direct their attention to areas we want to improve our development in.\n\nOf course, we could simply use our efforts to improve the number of grants for all tech industry research."

 Japan.100004111.t: "The Okinawan Independence Issue"
 Japan.100004111.d: "A significant but latent independence movement haunts the Ryukyu Islands, of which Okinawa is the most well known. The culture of the islands is thoroughly Japanized, but many people still hold onto a secondary Okinawan identity. This movement has faded in popularity in recent years, but the occasional scandal involving the central government or the enormous US military bases is enough to give it some traction every time something happens.\n\nThough we don't anticipate the issue coming to a head anytime in the near future, these headaches always require a significant investment in political capital to bring back into a favorable position. This creates instability in the island's politics, with current events always dominating local polls. We can apply our modern social sciences to help stabilize the population and encourage their priorities towards longer term issues, like growth and fiscal policy, rather than the latest American-driven disgrace."
 Japan.100004111.oA: "We need to improve their representation."
 Japan.100004111.oA_TT: "§GFuture issues related to Okinawa will be less impactful!§!"

 Japan.100004112.t: "Heavy Industry Research Coordination"
 Japan.100004112.d: "Many construction and manufacturing companies have their own research and development departments that don't share technical information, which is to be expected. However, we also have several projects of our own that are being developed. If we coordinate our progress with private industry, we can help reduce inefficiencies and bring the pace of their growth up as well. We just need to determine what area to focus on."
 Japan.100004112.oA: "We're lacking in nanofiber innovation."

 Japan.100004113.t: "Satellite Modernization Program"
 Japan.100004113.d: "With the inauguration of JAXA, we need an initial direction to take it in! The natural course is to improve our array of satellites, which are struggling to keep up with modern demand. One thing to note is that Global Positioning System is becoming more difficult to use for precise tasks- the signal is rather weak, making its use in the highly developed urban centers of Japan rather limited. We'll need to replace GPS eventually, and there's no reason to wait for the Americans to do it.\n\nOn the other hand, we can push that replacement back and continue to improve our technology in communications and imaging satellites, which we have a decent foothold in already. Or, we can just save the funds and put it into procurement of satellites and launch vehicles."
 Japan.100004113.oA: "We need a modernization of GPS."
 Japan.100004113.oB: "All of our satellites are falling behind."
 Japan.100004113.oC: "Better to purchase more of what we have."
 Japan.100004140.t: "The International High-Performance Computing Organization"
 Japan.100004140.d: "There are many private international conferences and associations related to the development of supercomputers, but there is still not much interest between governments in closely coordinating research. This means that a lot of redundant research is being repeated across all of the many countries that are at the bleeding edge of high-performance computing. We could change this if we invited these countries to jointly share their resources devoted to supercomputer development.\n\nOf course, the danger in this is that if too few countries actually bother to contribute to this development pool, we won't actually get a worthwhile return on our investment."
 Japan.100004140.oA: "Send out proposals!"
 Japan.100004140.oB: "Let's keep our funds at home."
 Japan.100004141.t: "Invitation to the IHPCO"
 Japan.100004141.d: "[FROM.GetNameWithFlag] has come forward with an unusual offer. They wish to draw our supercomputing research efforts together and coordinate them as part of a unified organization, which they are calling the International High-Performance Computing Organization. This is something we would expect to see for more basic technology, like agriculture or construction, but high performance computing research has traditionally been coordinated only by private associations.\n\nAs part of this, [FROM.GetNameWithFlag] is contributing a significant sum of money to jumpstart this coordination, and is asking for interested nations to commit funds to next quarter's research goals. If we join, there's no guarantee this arrangement will actually be successful- though, the more countries contribute, the more likely it is that we will get a worthwhile return on our investment."

 Japan.100004145.t: "International Supercomputing Efforts Stall Out!"
 Japan.100004145.d: "Despite our members' contributions and several apparent breakthroughs over the last month, the research organized between members of the IHPCO appears to have stalled out! The findings published are still of interest to global supercomputing efforts as a whole, but given the amount of funding dedicated to this project this is a very disappointing result."

 Japan.100004147.d: "With great excitement, the International High-Performance Computing Organization has published the results of its last month of survey and collaboration between its member countries. There's a wealth of advances gathered from this collaboration, despite the doubts of many that a unified supercomputing research organization could get off the ground. We can put these remarkable advances to use in our supercomputing development immediately."

 Japan.100004148.t: "Chinese Supercomputers?"
 Japan.100004148.d: "While sending invitations to the IHPCO, the question of [CHI.GetNameWithFlag]'s fledgling supercomputing development has come up. Some in the government are suggesting that we should decline to send them an invitation, worried that they will not contribute fairly and reap the rewards of our funding and research. Practically speaking, the issue is more cutthroat: do we want to help China advance their supercomputing technology, or are they not to be trusted?"
 Japan.100004148.oA: "Let's bring them on board."
 Japan.100004148.oB: "Better not."
 Japan.100004200.t: "The Future of Japanese Conservatism"
 Japan.100004200.d: "Japan is a culturally conservative society, but unlike many western countries, this doesn't mean there is a common conservative policy. Arguments of social insurance, healthcare, environmental concerns, homosexual rights, and other diverse issues are commonplace in the LDP, and many small parties have split off and merged over disagreements in what \"conservatism\" actually means in Japan.\n\nConfidence in conservatism today is low after it failed to protect society's most vulnerable during the Lost Decade, and youth interest in political issues is at an all time low. To safeguard against future radicalism, we need to decide on a trajectory for conservative politics. That direction will depend on what issue is most important for Japan to address."
 Japan.100004200.oA: "The current LDP leadership has the right idea."

A popular position is that many children grew up seeing their parents struggling to make ends meet, bruising their trust in the system to reward hard work after finishing a grueling education.\n\nWhatever the cause, we're likely to see more of this from students who have lost their attachment to society- made worse by the increasing popularity of online forums and chat rooms.\n\nOf course, conservative voices are fighting back with accusations that children are becoming spoiled by excessive access to consumer goods, making them restless and angry when their parents' wallets tighten."

 Japan_Demographic.100000100.t: "The Setting Sun"
 Japan_Demographic.100000100.d: "Japan's future is in peril. As a result of shrinking growth, a drought of business opportunities is pushing startups toward the already limited office space in Tokyo. Chasing this opportunity, educated young adults have begun to flee their stagnating cities and compete for increasingly cramped apartment space and jobs that impose staggering workloads on a limited workforce.\n\nFor similar reasons, families have become fewer and fewer in the last decade. Young adults are breaking under the pressure to find a job in this environment, and elderly workers are retiring faster than new workers are able or willing to replace them.\n\nThe Shūken, or Centralization, of business opportunities towards Tokyo will strangle our growth. Simultaneously, the Kaso, or Depopulation, is preventing businesses from filling positions.\n\nThese two issues will get worse every §Ytwo years§! until we reach a significant level of reform in each area. The these effects will become more severe after §Rfour years§!."

Though we have made progress in handling the centralization of growth towards Kanto, we are seeing frightening consequences for our workforce developing, and the public is taking notice of the effects of this.\n\nBusinesses are struggling to fill positions, and students are dropping out in record numbers. Elderly people forced into retirement due to their age are taking their own lives to avoid becoming a burden to their loved ones.\n\nWe can, at the very least, alleviate some of these issues by committing to a §GWelfare State§! or §GExtensive Welfare State§!, but we must maintain this level of social support until we see the effects of our efforts sometime during the coming year.\n\nIn the meantime, we need to make a statement about this situation, but more urgently we need to advance our reform in the handling the depopulation crisis, even a little, before we lose control of the situation!"

 Japan_Demographic.100000205.d: "Only a year has passed since our evaluation of the demographic crisis looming over Japan. Fortunately, the effort we have put into our reforms in both the issues of depopulation and centralization have had a positive effect on the overall demographic crisis.\n\nThough Tokyo's overcrowding issue is still present, we have slowed the flight of business and workers towards the stressed metropolis. Additionally, people are becoming more comfortable with family subsidies and revisions to labor reforms, even if the change is a stressful period of adjustment.\n\nAll we need to do for the next year is stay the course, and we should have a good effect when we next evaluate our progress. We will need to continue our reforms for the following biannual review, but we can firmly say we are on the right track.\n\nFor the moment, all we need to do is concern ourselves with the spoils of our efforts: shall we have a speech to cement our position, or let the opposition struggle to think of something to say in our place?"

Avoidable deaths are on the rise, young people are despondent and the elderly have nowhere to turn to. People are pessimistic that our reforms are having any effect in turning the situation around, and our analysts agree that the situation will get worse if we do not §Gadvance our reform§! further.\n\nIn the meantime, we need to provide a public response to this issue.\n\nMaintaning a §GWelfare State§! or §GExtensive Welfare State§! will provide a bonus to our reform efforts, but this alone is not enough.

 Japan_Demographic.100000521.t: "Pension Scandal!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000521.d: "Trust in our social reforms has been badly shaken by an incident in which multiple Diet members have been accused of pension payment evasion. The point of this reform was to ensure that all citizens are contributing their pension payments fairly, and it has successfully uncovered a systemic void in necessary payments. Unfortunately, this gap is from the ledgers of multiple Diet members, including many in our party.\n\nEven though we had hoped this accountability reform would improve public confidence in our social programs, this ugly revelation has convinced many that any government operated pension system will be riddled with corruption. We must continue to reform how we handle the Depopulation issue in spite of this, or this will simply happen on a larger scale again."

 Japan_Demographic.100000523.d: "Birth rates are up, people are feeling more comfortable relying on social services, and the dark cloud of overwork, unemployment, and hopelessness is lifting from Japan. We are even beginning to pull ahead of other Asian countries that are suffering from declining birthrates.\n\nSo long as we retain this level of social spending, we can be reasonably sure that things will continue to improve over the next few years. Any further effort advancing our reform may ease our need to lean on our social spending, but otherwise is no longer necessary to continue this trend."
 Japan_Demographic.100000523.oA: "Great!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000602.t: "Depopulation Crisis Reform Complete"
 Japan_Demographic.100000602.d: "Finally, the worst of the depopulation crisis is behind us. There is little more we can do to further improve the last remaining issues without also bringing the centralization crisis under control. Once we have done that, we can draft policies that can combine the administrative systems for the centralization and depopulation systems, and optimize them to take advantage of the framework we have created!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000602.oA: "Great!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000602.oB: "Optimize and combine our reform policies!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000603.t: "Demographics Reform Unified!"
 Japan_Demographic.100000603.d: "We've done it! Many naysayers abroad had considered Japan's future bleak, but we have silenced them all with our many years of hard work. Through careful analysis and administration of our reform policies, we have optimized our social subsidies and urban planning beyond what other countries have been able to replicate.\n\nTourism is booming in clean, beautiful cities all across Japan, and our new Shinkansen rolling stock are faster, larger, and more comfortable than ever before- slashing commuter traffic. Businesses are reporting record numbers of filled positions, and those that are unable to find work feel confident in our advanced social service system, which has become the shining star of Asian welfare."

On the other hand, some people apprehended that this situation would die out the present Imperial family line. The Prince-Consort Masako has been too advanced the age to have a baby so it was dangerous to have a second child. And if the Princess Aiko grewed up, she might become the Matrilineal Empress \"as the last imperial family\", because she has a large difference of the age comparetively between two Princes - Naruhito and Fumihito. But it would break the Imperial Household Law: The Imperial Throne is allowed only for the patrilineal line.

Investigation revealed that the train had entered the curve at approximately 116 km/h (72 mph), despite the section’s speed limit being 70 km/h (43 mph). The excessive speed likely caused the derailment due to centrifugal force.\nFThe driver was killed in the accident, but testimony from the conductor in the rear car suggested that the crew may have been attempting to make up for a delay of about 90 seconds. It was later reported that strict internal disciplinary measures existed within the company for even minor operational errors. These measures included re-education sessions, copying company rules by hand, and other corrective practices that had origins dating back to the privatization of the Japanese National Railways (JNR) during the Nakasone administration.\nFortunately, a limited express train approaching from the opposite direction was able to make an emergency stop due to the blocked track, avoiding a secondary collision. However, as the accident occurred during the morning rush hour, the train was crowded. In total, 107 people were killed and 562 were injured, making this the deadliest railway accident in postwar Japanese history.Some medical specialists noted that several passengers may not have died immediately in the crash but later due to crush syndrome resulting from prolonged compression."

 JAP_dca_foreign_labor: "Foreign Worker Exchange Agreements"
 JAP_dca_foreign_labor_desc: "Use the Development Cooperation Charter to sign worker exchange agreements with selected partner countries. Ministries match ageing Japanese industries with surplus labour abroad, set caps and skill lists, and require employers to provide language support and monitored housing. In return, sending states receive training guarantees and remittance schemes that feed money back into their own development plans."
 JAP_dca_investments: "Adventurous Development Investments"
 JAP_dca_investments_desc: "Allow Japan's development banks to take bolder stakes in high-risk, high-impact projects abroad under the Development Cooperation Charter. JBIC and JICA are encouraged to back ports, power grids and digital networks in frontier markets where private finance hesitates, trading safer returns for greater political influence and long-term economic ties."
 JAP_dca_bankers: "Global Development Bankers"
 JAP_dca_bankers_desc: "Push Japanese banks deeper into development finance under the Development Cooperation Charter. JBIC and megabanks like MUFG and Mizuho are encouraged to co-finance infrastructure and climate projects with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, turning Tokyo's lenders into visible players in global development deals instead of quiet backers in the background."
 JAP_dca_malacca: "Malacca Strait Shipping Talks"
 JAP_dca_malacca_desc: "Open talks with Singapore and Malaysia on how Japan's larger LNG carriers and container ships will move through the Malacca Strait in coming decades. Port upgrades at Singapore and Port Klang, new traffic separation schemes and joint funding for navigation aids are put on the table under the Development Cooperation Charter so vital shipping lanes stay open as vessels grow in size."
 JAP_dca_islands: "Develop Key Economic Islands"
 JAP_dca_islands_desc: "Channel Development Cooperation Charter funds into upgrading economically important islands such as Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. Projects focus on ports, tourism infrastructure and renewable energy so these remote territories can support trade, research and regional connectivity."
 JAP_dca_expand: "Expand the Development Cooperation Charter"
 JAP_dca_expand_desc: "Broaden the Development Cooperation Charter so it covers more partners and sectors. New guidelines add digital infrastructure, climate adaptation and maritime security to the list of priority fields, and embassies receive wider authority to propose projects that match Japan's strategic interests as well as local needs."

 #Monarchist
 JAP_restore_imperial_household: "Restore the Imperial Household"
 JAP_restore_imperial_household_desc: "For decades, the Imperial Household has been confined to ceremony, revered, yet separated from the levers of state. We will reverse that settlement by restoring institutional capacity and a formal role for the court in national administration. This is not pageantry, but a reordering of legitimacy that will force every faction to choose its side when the Chrysanthemum Throne steps forward."
 JAP_reinstate_former_imperial_houses: "Reinstate the Former Imperial Houses"
 JAP_reinstate_former_imperial_houses_desc: "The Imperial institution cannot endure on symbolism alone. Its future depends on continuity, stability, and a secure line of succession. We will reinstate the former imperial houses and restore their status within the national framework, expanding the pool of eligible branches tied to the Throne. This decision will be hailed as safeguarding tradition by monarchists and condemned as political engineering by constitutionalists."
 JAP_male_line_succession_act: "Pass the Male-Line Succession Act"
 JAP_male_line_succession_act_desc: "Succession uncertainty is a strategic vulnerability as much as a domestic controversy. We will codify male-line succession in statute to eliminate ambiguity and secure dynastic continuity for generations to come. The move will consolidate monarchist support, but it will ignite fierce opposition from reformers who see it as a step back from modern Japan."
 JAP_imperial_rites_restored: "Restore the Imperial Rites"
 JAP_imperial_rites_restored_desc: "A throne without ritual is a crown without weight. We will restore the Imperial rites as state-recognized ceremonies, reaffirming the sacred foundations of the monarchy and the continuity of the nation. In doing so, we bind the modern state to ancient legitimacy—whether the political class approves or not."
 JAP_recall_privy_council: "Recall the Privy Council"
 JAP_recall_privy_council_desc: "Parliamentary politics has become loud, transient, and increasingly detached from long-term statecraft. We will recall the Privy Council to provide the Throne with a permanent advisory body, discreet, experienced, and loyal to the continuity of the state. Its return will be seen as a stabilizing anchor by monarchists and as an unelected power center by its opponents."
 JAP_imperial_reform_commission: "Establish the Imperial Reform Commission"
 JAP_imperial_reform_commission_desc: "Restoration demands structure, not improvisation. We will establish an Imperial Reform Commission to draft the legal and institutional blueprint for a renewed monarchy and to align ministries, court offices, and security organs behind a single doctrine of state. Once convened, the commission will turn symbolism into policy and make retreat politically impossible."
 JAP_imperial_audience: "Hold an Imperial Audience"
 JAP_imperial_audience_desc: "The parties will be summoned not as equals, but as petitioners before the Throne. In a carefully staged Imperial Audience, we will bind faction leaders to a new order, one where elected politics serves, rather than commands, the state. If the Chrysanthemum Throne is to preside over a modern shogunate, it must first make the political class bow to its logic."
 JAP_imperial_civic_oath: "Proclaim the Imperial Civic Oath"
 JAP_imperial_civic_oath_desc: "A new order requires more than decrees; it requires shared allegiance. We will proclaim an Imperial Civic Oath that binds officials, servicemembers, and civil institutions to the Throne as the ultimate source of legitimacy. In doing so, we turn loyalty into law and make dissent feel like betrayal."
 JAP_unified_intelligence_secretariat: "Create a Unified Intelligence Secretariat"
 JAP_unified_intelligence_secretariat_desc: "A modern shogunate cannot be blind. We will consolidate competing services into a Unified Intelligence Secretariat that reports through a single chain of command and safeguards the Throne's strategic picture. This will sharpen our statecraft overnight, while giving our rivals every reason to fear what the court now knows."
 JAP_blue_water_navy: "Build a Blue-Water Navy"
 JAP_blue_water_navy_desc: "Japan's destiny is maritime, and our security cannot end at the horizon. We will build a true blue-water navy able to operate far from home waters, protect sea lanes, and project power where our interests demand. With the fleet as the Throne's steel instrument, the world will learn to measure Japan by the wake it leaves behind."
 JAP_imperial_defense_council: "Form the Imperial Defense Council"
 JAP_imperial_defense_council_desc: "Strategy cannot be left to electoral cycles and ministerial rivalry. We will form an Imperial Defense Council to unify the armed forces, intelligence leadership, and key ministries under a single strategic doctrine anchored to the Throne. In one stroke, Japan's security policy becomes coherent and far harder for factions to sabotage from within."
 JAP_rare_earth_resilience: "Secure Rare Earth Resilience"
 JAP_rare_earth_resilience_desc: "A great power can be strangled without a single shot fired by cutting the materials its industry cannot replace. We will secure rare earth resilience through stockpiles, diversified supply, and strategic extraction partnerships, insulating Japan from coercion. If the world wants to pressure us, it will have to find a different lever."
 JAP_national_shipbuilding_plan: "Imperial Fleet Expansion Programme"
 JAP_national_shipbuilding_plan_desc: "The Throne will not settle for coastal defense; Japan will command the seas that decide our fate. Under the Imperial Fleet Expansion Programme, we will surge shipyard capacity, lock in long-term naval procurement, and drive a continuous build cycle from keel-laying to commissioning. When this plan is underway, our rivals will not debate Japan's intentions they will count our hulls."
 JAP_imperial_war_cabinet: "Convene the Imperial War Cabinet"
 JAP_imperial_war_cabinet_desc: "In times of crisis, Japan cannot be governed by delay, committee, and partisan bargaining. We will convene an Imperial War Cabinet to centralize command authority and bind the political leadership to a single strategic line under the Throne's mandate. From this moment, the state will act with one voice and it will be the Emperor's."
 JAP_russian_lost_territories: "Reclaim the Northern Territories"
 JAP_russian_lost_territories_desc: "The wounds of the north have never closed only been covered by treaties and silence. We will press our claim to the islands and waters taken under Russian control, not as a plea, but as a sovereign demand backed by leverage and preparedness. If Moscow will not return what was lost, then Japan must decide how far it is willing to go to take it back."
 JAP_reclaim_pacific_rim: "Assert Our Pacific Rim Mandate"
 JAP_reclaim_pacific_rim_desc: "Japan's prosperity and security are written across the Pacific, from sea lanes to island chains and distant chokepoints. We will assert a Pacific Rim mandate that treats maritime influence as national policy backed by fleet presence, basing access, and economic leverage. The era of watching others draw the map is over; Japan will shape it."
 JAP_office_for_colonialism: "Revive the Daitōa-shō"
 JAP_office_for_colonialism_desc: "An empire without administration is a conquest that collapses under its own weight. We will revive the Daitōa-shō to coordinate overseas governance, security arrangements, and economic integration under a single imperial doctrine. With one ministry to direct the sphere, Japan's influence will no longer be improvised, it will be managed, expanded, and enforced."
 JAP_monarchist_shipbuilding_idea: "Imperial Naval Construction Drive"
 JAP_monarchist_shipbuilding_idea_desc: "The Empire will return to the sea as its natural domain. Under an Imperial Naval Construction Drive, shipyards are expanded, contracts are centralized, and production is pushed at sustained wartime tempo until the fleet matches Japan's ambition. Laid down in the Emperor's name, the seas belong to the Empire!."
 JAP_monarchist_shipbuilding_idea_tt: "§RThis idea will cancel when you are§! §G$naval_power_of_the_continent$§!"
 JAP_monarchist_idea_1: "Imperial Rule"
 JAP_monarchist_idea_1_desc: "The Throne has returned to command, and the state now moves by imperial mandate rather than party bargaining. Ministries, security organs, and industry are aligned under a single doctrine that treats the Emperor as the source of legitimacy and direction. Japan is governed with clarity again, and resistance carries a price."

 JAP_diplomacy.11.t: "U.S. Request to Reinterpret Article 9"
 JAP_diplomacy.11.d: "The government of the United States has approached us with a formal request to further reinterpret Article 9 of our Constitution. Washington argues that the regional security environment has deteriorated to such an extent that Japan must assume a greater share of the collective defense burden. Accepting their request would open the door to a broader understanding of self-defense,and to closer military cooperation, but it will not be without domestic controversy."
 JAP_diplomacy.11.a: "Accept the U.S. request"
 JAP_diplomacy.11.b: "We cannot accept this request"
 JAP_diplomacy.12.t: "Japan Refuses to Reinterpret Article 9"
 JAP_diplomacy.12.d: "Tokyo has informed us that it is not prepared to further reinterpret Article 9 at this time. Concerns over domestic public opinion, constitutional constraints, and political stability have led the Japanese government to reject our request. We must now decide whether to respect their decision or increase diplomatic and security pressure."
 JAP_diplomacy.12.a: "We will respect their decision"
 JAP_diplomacy.12.b: "Increase pressure on Japan"
 JAP_diplomacy.14.t: "U.S. Pressure on Article 9"
 JAP_diplomacy.14.d: "Following our refusal to broaden the interpretation of Article 9, the United States has quietly begun to increase diplomatic and security pressure on our government. Alliance consultations, media briefings, and behind-the-scenes messages all point in the same direction: Washington expects Japan to shoulder more responsibility. We can stand firm or quietly shift our stance."
 JAP_diplomacy.14.a: "We will stand firm"
 JAP_diplomacy.14.b: "Quietly adjust our position"
 JAP_diplomacy.15.t: "Japan Accepts Under Pressure"
 JAP_diplomacy.15.d: "After a period of heightened diplomatic and strategic pressure, Tokyo has indicated that it is prepared to move closer to our position on Article 9. While publicly insisting that Japan's pacifist principles remain unchanged, the government has now broadened its self-defense interpretation in a manner that aligns with our expectations."
 JAP_diplomacy.15.a: "Excellent"
 JAP_diplomacy.17.t: "U.S. Tariffs on Japanese Goods"
 JAP_diplomacy.17.d: "The United States has announced a new package of tariffs targeting key Japanese exports, citing economic imbalances and domestic political pressure. The measures are presented as a way to 'level the playing field,' but in Tokyo they are widely seen as a politically motivated move that will strain both our economy and the broader alliance."
 JAP_diplomacy.17.a: "We will have to adapt to this new reality"
 JAP_diplomacy.18.t: "Japan Requests Tariff Relief"
 JAP_diplomacy.18.d: "Tokyo has formally requested that we lift the tariffs imposed on Japanese goods. Japanese representatives hint that their government may be willing to deepen security cooperation and move further on defense policy in exchange. We must decide whether to turn this economic dispute into a strategic opportunity, or maintain the pressure."
 JAP_diplomacy.18.a: "Lift the tariffs in exchange for security concessions"
 JAP_diplomacy.18.b: "Refuse and keep the tariffs in place"
 JAP_diplomacy.19.t: "Tariffs Lifted, Security Concessions Demanded"
 JAP_diplomacy.19.d: "The United States has agreed to lift its tariffs on Japanese exports, but only as part of a broader understanding on security and defense. In practice, this means that Japan is expected to further broaden the interpretation of Article 9, deepening military cooperation with Washington and taking on a larger role in regional security."
 JAP_diplomacy.19.a: "For our economy and our alliance, we will accept this burden"
 JAP_diplomacy.20.t: "U.S. Refuses to Lift Tariffs"
 JAP_diplomacy.20.d: "Our formal request to lift the U.S. tariffs has been rejected. Washington insists that the measures will remain in place, citing domestic political pressures and unresolved disagreements over security policy. At home, frustration is growing among exporters and business leaders, while strategists warn that the dispute could further complicate our alliance."
 JAP_diplomacy.20.a: "We will have to endure the pressure for now"
 JAP_diplomacy.21.t: "Japan Requests Renewed Security Guarantees"
 JAP_diplomacy.21.d: "The Japanese government has formally requested renewed or strengthened security guarantees from the United States. Tokyo argues that the regional security environment has deteriorated and that a clearer U.S. commitment would help stabilize the situation. In private, Japanese officials acknowledge that further changes to the interpretation of Article 9 may be possible if Washington is prepared to make explicit commitments."
 JAP_diplomacy.21.a: "Restore our security guarantees in exchange for deeper commitments"
 JAP_diplomacy.21.b: "Refuse to extend our guarantees"
 JAP_diplomacy.22.t: "Security Guarantees Restored"
 JAP_diplomacy.22.d: "The United States has agreed to renew and clarify its security guarantees to Japan. In return, Washington expects Tokyo to take further steps in broadening the interpretation of Article 9 and assuming a greater share of regional security responsibilities. The alliance grows stronger, but the domestic debate over our pacifist principles will intensify."
 JAP_diplomacy.22.a: "For our security, we will accept this commitment"
 JAP_diplomacy.23.t: "U.S. Refuses Stronger Guarantees"
 JAP_diplomacy.23.d: "Our request for renewed or strengthened security guarantees has been rejected. The United States insists that existing arrangements are sufficient and that domestic political constraints limit any further commitments. Within Japan, this refusal will fuel concerns about our long-term security and the reliability of our alliance."
 JAP_diplomacy.23.a: "Then we must reconsider our own path"
 JAP_diplomacy.24.t: "Japan Requests an End to U.S. Naval Pressure"
 JAP_diplomacy.24.d: "Tokyo has formally requested that we scale back or end our heightened naval presence and pressure around key sea lanes and chokepoints. Japanese officials argue that the current posture risks escalation and undermines domestic support for the alliance. In private, they indicate that further changes to the interpretation of Article 9 may be possible if we ease our posture."
 JAP_diplomacy.24.a: "End the naval pressure in exchange for security concessions"
 JAP_diplomacy.24.b: "Maintain our naval pressure around Japan"
 JAP_diplomacy.25.t: "Naval Pressure Eased, Commitments Deepened"
 JAP_diplomacy.25.d: "The United States has agreed to ease its heightened naval presence around our sea lanes, in return for deeper security commitments from Japan. In practice, this means another step in broadening the interpretation of Article 9 and expanding our role in regional security. The alliance appears stronger, but the domestic debate over our pacifist identity will only grow more intense."
 JAP_diplomacy.25.a: "For the sake of stability, we will honor this deal"
 JAP_diplomacy.26.t: "U.S. Refuses to End Naval Pressure"
 JAP_diplomacy.26.d: "Our request to ease or end the heightened U.S. naval presence around our sea lanes has been rejected. Washington insists that the current posture is necessary in light of regional threats. At home, this refusal will fuel both fears of entrapment in a wider conflict and calls to further strengthen Japan's own defenses."
 JAP_diplomacy.26.a: "Then we must adapt under pressure"
 JAP_diplomacy.28.t: "Kaguya Lunar Design Complications"
 JAP_diplomacy.28.d: "The ambitious Kaguya lunar mission is encountering serious design challenges. Key systems are proving more complex than expected, from guidance and power management to thermal protection. Engineers argue that additional funding and time will allow them to redesign critical components and improve overall reliability, but the cost of doing so is already raising eyebrows in the cabinet."
 JAP_diplomacy.28.a: "Invest in redesign and keep the schedule tight"
 JAP_diplomacy.28.b: "Hold the line on costs and accept a longer timeline"
 JAP_diplomacy.29.t: "Kaguya Communications Vulnerabilities"
 JAP_diplomacy.29.d: "As testing continues, the Kaguya program reveals weaknesses in deep-space communications and data links. Signal integrity, bandwidth, and resistance to interference are all below target. Specialists propose new antennas, upgraded ground stations, and more robust encryption—but these improvements will require additional political and financial capital."
 JAP_diplomacy.29.a: "Upgrade the communications architecture"
 JAP_diplomacy.29.b: "Proceed with existing systems and hope for the best"
 JAP_diplomacy.30.t: "Further Delays for the Kaguya Mission"
 JAP_diplomacy.30.d: "Technical setbacks, integration issues, and scheduling conflicts with launch infrastructure have forced yet another delay to the Kaguya lunar mission. While the core systems remain promising, the project is increasingly viewed as slow and troubled. Scientists insist that patience will be rewarded, but public attention is beginning to drift elsewhere."
 JAP_diplomacy.30.a: "Accept the delay and push on toward the Moon"
 JAP_diplomacy.31.t: "Kaguya Reaches the Lunar Surface"
 JAP_diplomacy.31.d: "After years of design revisions, communications upgrades, and difficult delays, the Kaguya mission has finally succeeded. Japanese hardware now operates on and around the Moon, returning high-resolution imagery and invaluable scientific data. The achievement showcases Japan's high-tech capabilities and opens new paths for satellite development, deep-space exploration, and strategic space applications."
 JAP_diplomacy.31.a: "Celebrate Kaguya as a triumph of Japanese technology"

 jap_kaguya_rocketry_invest_tt: "§GBecause we invested in better communications with the spaceship, we gained:§!"
 JAP_diplomacy.32.t: "Guidance Software Anomaly"
 JAP_diplomacy.32.d: "Engineers on the Mars mission report a recurring anomaly in the guidance software. While the issue is not yet critical, it could compound into serious navigation errors if left unaddressed. Fixing it thoroughly will pull resources from other projects and may affect the overall schedule."
 JAP_diplomacy.32.a: "Divert resources and resolve it properly"
 JAP_diplomacy.32.b: "Accept delays and patch it gradually"
 JAP_diplomacy.33.t: "Naming the Mars Colony"
 JAP_diplomacy.33.d: "Japan has secured a permanent foothold on Mars. As habitats come online and the first long-term crews settle in, a symbolic decision awaits: the official name and character of the colony."

 JAP_mars_colony2: "Mars Colony Kagutsuchi"
 JAP_mars_colony2_desc: "Named after Kagutsuchi, the god of fire, Mars Colony 'Kagutsuchi' is built around furnaces, refineries and heavy industry. Its purpose is clear: to turn Martian ore and energy into strength for Japan's factories."
 JAP_mars_colony3: "Mars Colony Tsukuyomi"
 JAP_mars_colony3_desc: "Named after Tsukuyomi, the god of the moon and night, Mars Colony 'Tsukuyomi' serves as a quiet observatory and research complex. From its labs and instruments, data flows back to Japan, deepening scientific understanding."
 JAP_mars_colony4: "Mars Colony Susanoo"
 JAP_mars_colony4_desc: "Named after Susanoo, the storm-bringing deity, Mars Colony 'Susanoo' is shaped into a rugged frontier outpost. Training grounds and experimental ranges make it a crucible for Japan's armed forces and doctrines."

Local police, governors and residents must work around rules negotiated in Washington and Tokyo, and every crime, accident or noise complaint near a base is filtered through SOFA procedures before Japan can act."
