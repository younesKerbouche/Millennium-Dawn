 japan_focus: "Japanese Focus Tree"

 #National Focus
 #Domestic Tree
 JAP_trinity_reform: "Trinity Reform"
 JAP_trinity_reform_desc: "Employment, bureaucracy, education- our fiscal reform must approach all three areas of Japan's vulnerable state with care, or we are doomed to turn the Lost Decade into many more Lost Decades to come."
 #ECONOMICS AND LABOUR
 JAP_large_boned_policy: "Honebuto' Policy"
 JAP_large_boned_policy_desc: "Normally, the Ministry of Finance drafts the national budget based on the ruling party's positions. Some in the LDP are calling for this arrangement to be revised in order to combat the consquences of the Lost Decade, giving the Diet greater influence over what the Ministry of Finance proposes. They are calling this the 'Big-Boned' policy."
 JAP_socialism: "Japanese Socialism"
 JAP_socialism_desc: "The welfare of Japanese citizens cannot end at pensions and healthcare. Childcare and elderly that do not have families to rely on must be covered as well."
 JAP_protect_worker_rights: "Protect Workers' Rights"
 JAP_protect_worker_rights_desc: "Tokyo moves to tighten protections for Japan's workforce, strengthening labour standards, oversight of overtime practices and safeguards against exploitation. The reforms promise fairer conditions and greater security for workers, but raise concerns among employers about rising costs and reduced flexibility."
 JAP_save_ice_age: "Save the Ice Age Generation!"
 JAP_save_ice_age_desc: "During the Lost Decade, an entire generation of graduates became stranded with no opportunities by a failing economy. The effects of this have been catastrophic, with spiking rates of suicide and a sense of hopelessness among young adults who have given up on society. Some of these fall to despondent, radical thoughts. We must provide hope to the Lost Generation."
 JAP_neoliberalism: "Japanese Neoliberalism"
 JAP_neoliberalism_desc: "We must enrich all Japanese citizens by providing them the opportunity to succeed. To that end, we must help businesses grow. We must not be tempted by easy taxation promises that will strangle our tender economy and impoverish more than ever before."
 JAP_deregulate_temporary_staffing: "Deregulate Temporary Staffing"
 JAP_deregulate_temporary_staffing_desc: "Tokyo eases rules on temporary and dispatch work, giving companies more freedom to hire flexible labour through agencies. Business groups hail the move as a way to cut costs and adapt quickly, while unions warn of growing precarity and a weakening of Japan's traditional employment model."
 JAP_national_investments: "Assertive Samurai Bond Investment"
 JAP_national_investments_desc: "Japan enjoys one advantage from its tepid interest rates- it is quite attractive to foreign actors that wish to seek investment from Japanese investors. We could liquidate a few of our unprofitable international investments in order to finance some bond packages with some of our neighbors, which could have a positive effect on our domestic economy."
 JAP_intern_training: "Technical Intern Training Program"
 JAP_intern_training_desc: "Expand the Technical Intern Training Program to bring in foreign trainees for sectors struggling with labour shortages, such as manufacturing, agriculture and care work. This focus uses tightly controlled, temporary visas to lower labour pressure at home while officially framing the scheme as skills transfer rather than long-term immigration."
 JAP_liberal_syndicalism: "Trade Union Representatives"
 JAP_liberal_syndicalism_desc: "Reserving some seats in the Diet for representatives of major trade unions would give the unions a direct route to address their concerns to the national assembly and make them more cooperative with political issues. The question is, how much influence do we actually want to give them over elections?"
 JAP_labour_management: "Labour Management Director"
 JAP_labour_management_desc: "Appoint a dedicated Labour Management Director to mediate between firms and workers, standardise dispute resolution and monitor compliance with labour law. This focus improves coordination on wages, conditions and restructuring plans across key industries."
 JAP_industrial_union: "Industrial Union"
 JAP_industrial_union_desc: "Restructure fragmented workplace unions into larger, industry-wide organisations that can negotiate sector-level agreements. This focus trades some firm-by-firm flexibility for clearer bargaining frameworks, more consistent wages and stronger representation in key industrial sectors."
 JAP_struggle_high_low: "The Struggle of High and Low"
 JAP_struggle_high_low_desc: "It is too simplistic to blame everything on capitalism, or to dismiss our reforms as communism. Our nation must be unified in spirit, devoted to each other and our respective talents. The worker and the owner, the state and the citizen, each of these cannot exist without the other. We will become one organism, and overcome adversity together."
 JAP_discretionary_labour_laws: "Legislate Discretionary Labour"
 JAP_discretionary_labour_laws_desc: "Discretionary labour allows for an employee's salary to factor potential overtime into a static rate, which enables employers to supervise their employees less. Of course, this method can and has been abused to pressure employees to work more for less pay. We need to make sure it's flexible but fair."
 JAP_subsidy_optimization: "Subsidy Optimization"
 JAP_subsidy_optimization_desc: "One of the largest complaints that small businsses have with applying for subsidies is how top heavy the system feels. For a simple bond or relief package, the noodle stand must fill out the same paperwork meant for Mitsubishi. We will have to dedicate a lot of effort to changing this, but we will remove one of the largest impediments to small businesses."
 JAP_elder_labour: "Shōgai Gen'eki"
 JAP_elder_labour_desc: "Promote the Shōgai Gen'eki ideal of remaining active for life by expanding schemes that keep older citizens in the workforce. This focus encourages firms to rehire retirees, offer flexible hours and adapt workplaces so experienced workers can stay on, easing labour shortages while supporting pension finances."
 JAP_rebuild_lost_generation: "Rebuild the Lost Generation"
 JAP_rebuild_lost_generation_desc: "The shape of labour in Japan is forever changed, and the workforce is finally starting to become comfortable with that fact. Young workers feel that they can balance their work and life, older workers feel valued by their companies and communities. And, we did it without destroying our economy!"
 JAP_universal_child_benefit: "Universal Child Benefit"
 JAP_universal_child_benefit_desc: "Introduce or expand a universal child allowance paid for every child regardless of parental income. This focus shifts resources toward families, helping to cover education and living costs and signalling that the state is serious about supporting childrearing in an aging society."
 JAP_ban_zangyo: "Ban Minashi Zangyō"
 JAP_ban_zangyo_desc: "Karoshi- death by overwork- has been on the rise for several years, as a consequence of a shrinking workforce. We cannot overcome the societal pressure to accept predatory overtime expectations through social change alone, we must leglislate protection that protects workers from their own sense of obligation."
 JAP_nenko_wage: "Reinterpret the Nenko Wage System"
 JAP_nenko_wage_desc: "The old seniority-wage system was flawed in many ways, but its removal has left many retirees who planned around it with insufficient savings that their pensions cannot compensate for. We're ready to change this. We can roll our social reform progress into a new pension, childcare, and unemployment system that protects all Japanese citizens."
 JAP_counter_union: "Cabinet-Led Union Counter-Offensive"
 JAP_counter_union_desc: "Launch a coordinated cabinet effort to curb the rising influence of militant labour unions. This focus strengthens government oversight of industrial action, tightens rules on collective bargaining leverage and backs employers in resisting disruptive strikes, aiming to reassert state authority over wage and workplace disputes."
 JAP_price_escalation: "Controlled Price Escalation"
 JAP_price_escalation_desc: "Businesses are growing the fastest they have in a decade, but we need to prepare for a wave of labour returning to the workforce. We will print enough currency to encourage new construction, but we must capitalize on this burst of growth in order for it to be worth the resulting devaluation of the Yen that will follow!"
 JAP_union_liaison: "Council for Industrial-Union Affairs"
 JAP_union_liaison_desc: "We have dramatically modernized the way labour in Japan functions, and not all aspects of industry have been able to catch up. We need to ensure that the trade union federations and the industrial interests are able to shake hands after so much of society has changed. To do this, we will create a council to coordinate the needs of both."
 JAP_national_minimum_wage: "National Minimum Wage"
 JAP_national_minimum_wage_desc: "Introduce a unified national minimum wage to replace the patchwork of regional standards. This focus lets the government lift the floor under low-paid work, simplify rules for employers and use wage policy as a tool against in-work poverty and stagnant consumption."
 JAP_relaxed_immigration: "Relaxed Immigration"
 JAP_relaxed_immigration_desc: "Loosen immigration rules to make it easier for foreign workers and professionals to settle in Japan. This focus raises visa quotas, simplifies residency paths and accepts more long-term migrants to ease labour shortages and support the tax base."
 JAP_migrant_monitoring: "Migrant Monitoring"
 JAP_migrant_monitoring_desc: "Tighten oversight of foreign residents by expanding registration, workplace inspections and data-sharing between agencies. This focus seeks to reassure the public about immigration controls while keeping closer track of abuse, overstays and illegal employment."
 JAP_improved_naturalization: "Help Foreign Workers"
 JAP_improved_naturalization_desc: "We will reorganize some tax laws and coordinate with several countries we already have visa agreements with so that foreign workers will enjoy more favorable financial conditions while working in Japan, such as streamlining their tax documentation. This does not mean we will commit to more open immigration, but we will make life easier for foreign workers."
 JAP_control_labour_immigrants: "Streamlined Naturalization Process"
 JAP_control_labour_immigrants_desc: "We will standardize a way for foreign nationals seeking permanent residency to accelerate their application. Normally, foreign nationals must reside in Japan for 10 years before earning eligibility for permanent residency. If they speak Japanese fluently and have a stable source of income and career experience, this could be shortened to just 3 years."
 JAP_maternity_tax_reduction: "Expanded Maternity Benefits"
 JAP_maternity_tax_reduction_desc: "Women on maternity leave receive several benefits and compensation already, but we can extend this to fathers taking time off to take care of their family. Additionally, we can subsidize families for each additional child they have. It will be expensive, and reduce our nominal workforce for a time, but the baby boom will pay off."
 JAP_adoption_tax_reduction: "Adoption Tax Reduction"
 JAP_adoption_tax_reduction_desc: "Offer tax reductions and allowances to families who adopt children, including from foster care. This focus supports diverse family structures, eases the financial burden of adoption and helps match children in need with stable households."
 JAP_shine_all_women: "A Society Where All Women Shine"
 JAP_shine_all_women_desc: "Japan must adapt its expectations as a modern society. Men must no longer feel that they are expected to be the sole providers for a family any longer. We must encourage women who are willing to support a family with a full time job. To do this, we must encourage women to seek opportunity- and assure them that they will not be turned away."
 JAP_yamato_nadeshiko: "Yamato Nadeshiko"
 JAP_yamato_nadeshiko_desc: "In order to inspire and motivate women, we must change the way they are viewed by society. They must not be treated as delicate flowers to shun when they reach towards opportunity. Japan cannot remain in the past- we must be willing to let go, even if it means leaving behind a piece of our sentimentality in the past."
 #GOVERNMENT AND DIRECTION
 JAP_central_government_reform: "Central Government Reform"
 JAP_central_government_reform_desc: "Despite actions to privatize many companies in the 80s and 90s, the bureaucatic system that runs Japan's services is inefficient and, in some cases, prone to corruption. Some voices call for smaller government, other voices just want greater accountability for civil servants. Either choice has its drawbacks and will not be easy to reverse course from."
 JAP_cease_privatization: "Cease Privatisation"
 JAP_cease_privatization_desc: "Suspend ongoing privatisation schemes and keep key assets under direct state control. This focus halts further sell-offs, allowing the government to prioritise public service, employment and long-term stability over short-term revenue gains."
 JAP_full_independent_audit: "Full Independent Audit"
 JAP_full_independent_audit_desc: "The Kaikeikensain, or Board of Audit, is responsible for reviewing the government's expenditures and comparing them to the budget to ensure finances are being appropriately allocated. Often, submissions to the board are confusing and difficult to read, as the given guidelines are not subject to censure when violated. We will change this, and verify our expenditures are above, at, or below budget."
 JAP_oversight_forum: "Representative Oversight Forum"
 JAP_oversight_forum_desc: "The seats in the Diet should not just be filled with warm bodies. We will put into practice a new system of parliamentary oversight to review the local effects for the laws passed by current and previous administrations. We will collect information through surveys and non-political groups in order to repeal laws that have negatively impacted the people."
 JAP_ombudsman: "National Financial Ombudsman"
 JAP_ombudsman_desc: "Though there are options for citizens to lodge complaints at a local level, the impact of national laws on citizens is largely invisible to the national government. We can create an office designed to process complaints and disputes regarding civil services and ensure these services are reaching everyone."
 JAP_third_agrarian_reform: "Third Agrarian Reform"
 JAP_third_agrarian_reform_desc: "There are many small plots of undesirable, abandoned land that is privately owned but not being exploited for development. Due to the economic effects of the Lost Decade, there is little desire to sell off these lands, and adjacent farmers are unwilling to pay a high price. If we buy these lands at asking price and distribute them to farmers, it will stimulate the land market and increase productivity."
 JAP_continue_privatization: "Continue Privatisation"
 JAP_continue_privatization_desc: "The issue of the postal service's inefficiencies and failures is the final straw in a long list of ways the Japanese bureaucratic system has betrayed the society it is supposed to provide for. We are in a unique position to change the trajectory for Japan's economy, even if the discourse surrounding it splits the party."
 JAP_service_corporatization: "Civil Service Corporatisation"
 JAP_service_corporatization_desc: "In order to transition more civil services to the private sector, we will put up shares of these formerly nationalised services on the market. This will allow us to sell off our own shares and reduce our debt, but will throw our services into chaos, forcing us to spend more in the short term."
 JAP_corporatization_goal: "Corporatisation Goal"
 JAP_corporatization_goal_desc: "Corporatization of civil services lets the government retain ownership of all shares in the company. This helps with fiscal transparency and market competition, but it doesn't help relieve our tax burden from running these companies when they do poorly. However, it is sensible to keep certain financial and infrastructure companies at this level of ownership."
 JAP_privatization_goal: "Full Privatization Goal"
 JAP_privatization_goal_desc: "Selling all shares of our reorganized service companies to stockholders has benefits beyond the added pressure to profit- we can financially assist them more readily when their market is threatened without as much public objection, as well as tax their revenue when their market is performing well."
 JAP_end_arp: "End 'Gentan' Policy"
 JAP_end_arp_desc: "The Acreage Reduction Policy is the result of a complicated price fixing scheme developed in the 70s. In short, today's large farmers take Gentan subsidies to produce soybeans or other crops in place of rice; in exchange, they limit their production of rice to keep prices high. If we're going to phase out Gentan, we need to decide how we're going to do it."
 JAP_anticorruption_committee: "Accountable Fiscal Reform"
 JAP_anticorruption_committee_desc: "A strong government must have a transparent system of accountability for all officials with the authority to make important decisions. This means more than just a strong audit board, it means close examination of all financial ties, relationships, and promises of officials. If any incident of corruption gets past this barrier, it will be embarrassing and costly for us to clean up."
 JAP_digital_archives: "Digital Archives"
 JAP_digital_archives_desc: "Government ministries begin converting paper files, legal records and historical documents into secure digital formats. Centralised databases replace aging storage rooms, allowing administrators, researchers and auditors to access information quickly and trace decisions with far greater clarity."
 JAP_anticorruption_computerization: "Oversight Reduction Policy"
 JAP_anticorruption_computerization_desc: "With a strong emphasis on countering corruption before it takes root, we can make assumptions in our fiscal and personnel policy to make effective reductions in our expenses devoted to policing our bureaucracy. We will only benefit from these optimizations, however, if we maintain a bureaucratic culture that rejects corruption."
 JAP_countercorruption_law: "Counter-Corruption Law"
 JAP_countercorruption_law_desc: "We cannot possibly create a system that will catch all cases of backdoor dealings that will also be cost effective. Instead of trying to stop corruption before it appears, we should create the framework for a system that rewards those who blow the whistle on illicit activities."
 JAP_diet_countercorruption: "Kokkai Investigative Powers"
 JAP_diet_countercorruption_desc: "Strengthen Kokkai authority to investigate corruption by expanding committee subpoena powers, tightening testimony requirements and granting broader access to ministry records. Parliamentary hearings are meant to become a serious check on misconduct, putting senior officials and corporate executives under direct scrutiny from elected representatives."
 JAP_iron_triangle: "Crush the Iron Triangle"
 JAP_iron_triangle_desc: "The relationship between bureaucratic officials, businessmen, and politicians has a fatal flaw- the ambition of opposing politicians. We will push to allow the minority government in the Diet to call for special inquiries against the ruling coalition in certain circumstances. This will slow down our government's ability to act, but will make corruption almost trivial to root out by creating an incentive to find it."
 JAP_2nd_government_reform: "Second Central Government Reform"
 JAP_2nd_government_reform_desc: "Creating greater transparency and accountability in our bureaucratic system has helped, but we are left with a tangle of laws that are redundant- and, in some cases, full of loopholes. A second wave of legislation and reform will revitalize our bureaucatic system, reducing costs and trimming unnecessary staffing."
 JAP_anti_revolving: "Destroy Amakudari"
 JAP_anti_revolving_desc: "Introduce strict rules to break the amakudari revolving door between ministries and the companies they regulate. Cooling-off periods are lengthened, post-retirement job approvals are tightened, and senior officials are barred from taking lucrative advisory roles in firms they once oversaw, aiming to loosen the grip of old-boy networks on public policy."
 JAP_government_safeguard: "To Safeguard"
 JAP_government_safeguard_desc: "Government's role is to secure, not provide. We will protect businesses from threats they could not anticipate, but we will not coddle them and reward them for failing to plan ahead. Business shall not guide the hand of policy."
 JAP_legislated_revolving: "Reinterpreted Amakudari"
 JAP_legislated_revolving_desc: "Set out a revised interpretation of amakudari that permits limited post-retirement employment for experienced officials under tighter, legally defined conditions. Clear boundaries on advisory roles, disclosure requirements and approval procedures are introduced to retain valuable expertise without allowing undue influence over former regulatory domains."
 JAP_government_enrich: "To Enrich"
 JAP_government_enrich_desc: "Government's role is to enrich. This extends to business, as well. To do this, we will reinvest corporate taxes back into businesses according to policy agreed upon by both public and private companies and moderated by union leaders. The boundary between public and private is blurred in the 21st century, and we will embrace it!"
 JAP_reacquire_public_corporations: "Expand Public Ownership"
 JAP_reacquire_public_corporations_desc: "Prior privatization measures were intended to reduce the national debt, but the economic slump has not produced the competition needed to materialize the fair prices it was meant to provide. We will buy back enough shares to hold a majority of these companies. It's not an option to allow our most vulnerable people go without affordable rail and telecom."
 JAP_wealth_taxation: "Reorganized Taxation System"
 JAP_wealth_taxation_desc: "The second phase of reacquiring public services is a complete redraft of the taxation system. We have to change how we interact with corporations to cover the cost of reacquiring public services. This will be a difficult road and will harm corporate productivity, but merely trying to grow our way out of debt has not worked for a decade. It's time for a new approach."
 JAP_nationalise_infrastructure: "Nationalize Major Industries"
 JAP_nationalise_infrastructure_desc: "The ultimate goal of state ownership is the central control of all critical infrastructure. This includes transportation networks, telecom, air and sea terminals, resource extraction, and power generation, to name a few. All of these, when managed like a business, can be profitable. Stability is more important than profitability in the 21st century."
 JAP_green_investment: "Payment for Ecosystem Services"
 JAP_green_investment_desc: "State control over infrastructure is a mire of expenses and bureaucracy we do not want to commit to. Instead, our control should nudge infrastructure, resource extraction, and power generation towards sustainable solutions through incentives and subsidies. Ultimately, we hope to see a careful evolution of the economy, not a revolution."
 JAP_redundant: "Redundant Sustainability"
 JAP_redundant_desc: "Japan's vulnerability to natural disasters means that it is also vulnerable to disruptions to the global supply chain. Evolutions in renewable energy will help reduce dependency on unreliable fossil fuels as well as expensive nuclear expansions, as well as protecting our infrastructure through redundant power systems."
 JAP_e_japan: "e-Japan Initiative"
 JAP_e_japan_desc: "Unveil a national e-Japan strategy that treats high-speed networks and digital services as core infrastructure. Ministries, schools and hospitals are pushed onto broadband platforms, online procedures replace paper counters, and incentives draw private investment into fibre and mobile networks, aiming to make Japan a leading information society rather than a country of fax machines and aging systems."
 JAP_abolish_privilege: "Bureaucratic Privilege Assessment"
 JAP_abolish_privilege_desc: "Some state employees, such as Diet representatives, enjoy special privileges that, in addition to being controversial, are taxing on the budget. Special rent prices, free travel, an excessive allowance on top of their salary. These must be evaluated and adjusted to what is actually necessary to do their job."
 JAP_cut_off_salary: "Cut Bureaucrats' Salaries"
 JAP_cut_off_salary_desc: "Announce a cut in senior bureaucrats' salaries and allowances as a visible gesture of restraint from the top of the state. Pay scales for upper ranks are trimmed, bonuses reduced and certain perks cancelled, sending a signal that officials will share in the sacrifices demanded of taxpayers and frontline workers."
 JAP_bureaucracy_amendment: "Bureaucratic Reform Amendment"
 JAP_bureaucracy_amendment_desc: "New agencies and services added to the budget will require the Diet to come to a fiscal concensus, first. This will create a barrier to new spending that encourages reform over addition. This will increase the trust in our level of taxation, rather than cutting it further."
 JAP_concessional_water_business: "Utilities Privatization"
 JAP_concessional_water_business_desc: "We will go further than just the postal services. Introducing competition to utilities, like water collection and processing, will help provide better service and maintenance to the aging infrastructure that supports it. This will ultimately provide better prices to customers, once factored into the tax relief they will receive."
 JAP_tourism_and_casino: "Tourism and Casino Business"
 JAP_tourism_and_casino_desc: "Gambling in most forms is illegal in Japan. Though this is a socially responsible measure, it means that a lucrative market for tourism is totally closed off. Worse, it encourages illegal gambling, enriching criminal organizations. Legalizing and regulating the gambling market will bring in more revenue, as well as fight crime."
 JAP_private_social_securities: "Social Securities Privatization"
 JAP_private_social_securities_desc: "Complete privatization of social services will require comprehensive reform of the private pensions market. Aside from creating a special company from the Social Insurance Agency, the first step is to open up options for those who want to opt out of the National Pension. This will be expensive at first, but we will save our citizens massive amounts in taxation in the long term."
 #social tree
 JAP_mil_sunrise: "Millennium Sunrise"
 JAP_mil_sunrise_desc: "Media, technology, and education are all part of the vastly expanding information spectrum that developed nations depend on. In order to recapture Japan's place at the forefront of the world's research and development, we must reinvigorate all three of these fields out of the scars of the 20th century."
 JAP_dissolve_kisha_club: "Kisha Club Reform"
 JAP_dissolve_kisha_club_desc: "Press clubs are intended to ensure that accredited journalists have easy, immediate access to information direct from sources in companies and the government. In reality, the kisha clubs of Japan shake hands and exchange favors with the entities they are supposed to keep watch over. We need to regulate and diminish the exclusive nature of these associations."
 JAP_domestic_journalism: "Domestic Media Freedom"
 JAP_domestic_journalism_desc: "Large media companies dominate the information space in Japan. Freelancers and small outlets have a difficult time getting access to information before it becomes monopolized by large media conglomerates. After regulating the kisha clubs, we must now go after institutional favoritism."
 JAP_journalism_solidarity: "Press Freedom Goal"
 JAP_journalism_solidarity_desc: "Ultimately, the goal of press freedom is to nurture a responsible, stable society that can adapt and police itself, regardless of ideology or outlook. We will commit to removing obstructive laws, monetary obstacles, and ultimately tear down the culture of silence that domestic reporters are compelled to submit to."
 JAP_alpha_influencer: "Cultivate Internet Influence"
 JAP_alpha_influencer_desc: "The rise of internet platforms like bloggers and \"Youtubers\" is a serious challenge to conventional media- and, by extension, the stability of information reaching ordinary people. This is the future of information, and we should invest in building a presence for national media on these platforms now."
 JAP_global_journalism: "Global Internet Presence"
 JAP_global_journalism_desc: "Other countries wield national media as a powerful tool for international influence. Classic giants like the BBC and newer contenders like Al-Jazeera have the eyes and ears and- most importantly- minds of millions who live beyond their home country's borders. Japan must seize this emergent form of soft power by expanding funding for NHK-World from a TV channel to a multimedia giant."
 JAP_cultural_export: "Cool Japan Digital Export"
 JAP_cultural_export_desc: "Pour new money into the Cool Japan Fund and push anime studios, game publishers and music labels to chase global streaming audiences. Aniplex and Toei negotiate extra slots on Netflix and Crunchyroll, Sony Music and Avex line up J-pop and idol content for YouTube and TikTok, and VTuber agencies like Hololive and Nijisanji are encouraged to add English and Korean channels. Foreign timelines fill up with Japanese series, clips and livestreams, and tourism ads start riding on the back of every viral opening song and character collab."
 JAP_e_commerce_ease: "E-Commerce Entry Reform"
 JAP_e_commerce_ease_desc: "Lower the barriers for small businesses to enter Japan's major online marketplaces. Rakuten and Yahoo! Shopping simplify registration for new sellers, Amazon Japan expands its fulfilment slots for domestic SMEs, and local governments offer digital onboarding help for rural shops. Family-run bakeries, craft stores and second-hand dealers that once relied on foot traffic can now open nationwide storefronts with a single application."
 JAP_parallel_internet_society: "Parallel Society"
 JAP_parallel_internet_society_desc: "The simple fact is that the internet is a social ecosystem outside of traditional society, and it is a waste of resources to try to force it to conform. We will establish several laws that protect unconventional commentary and anonymity on the internet- in all of its strange, esoteric forms."
 JAP_flexible_copyright: "Adaptive Copyright"
 JAP_flexible_copyright_desc: "Japanese copyright law is extremely strict and, in some ways, unsuited for the internet age. As an example, under current law, there is no provision for a \"fair use\" of material for criticism or discussion. Providing this, among other concessions, would encourage organizations as well as ordinary citizens to draw attention to issues in media."
 JAP_freedom_of_internet: "Open Internet Charter"
 JAP_freedom_of_internet_desc: "The cabinet signs an Open Internet Charter that limits how far ministries and police can reach into online speech. Content takedown requests are narrowed to clear crimes, court warrants are required before providers hand over browsing logs, and vague ‘public order' clauses are stripped from telecom rules. Encrypted messaging apps and independent news sites operate with fewer quiet threats in the background, and internet users begin to speak more freely about politics and scandals."
 JAP_e_commerce_strict: "Regulated Domain Hosting"
 JAP_e_commerce_strict_desc: "The government moves to tighten control over who can run a .jp website. JPRS and major hosting firms like Sakura Internet, Xserver and GMO are ordered to carry out strict identity checks, keep detailed customer records and respond quickly to takedown notices. Small online shops and personal blogs are told to file real-name registration and proof of address before their domains are renewed, and overseas hosts serving Japanese users face new pressure to keep data on servers inside Japan."
 JAP_control_internet_society: "Part of Society"
 JAP_control_internet_society_desc: "Strange, deviant subcultures congregate on internet forums and use tools like Tor or VPNs to conceal their identity, and then use this anonymity to defame and harass people. Some of these forums embrace distasteful comparisons to terrorist cults like Aum Shinrikyo. There is a limit to what civilized society can tolerate, and these cultures are well past it. We will restrict the extent to which online anonymity may exist."
 JAP_strict_copyright: "Strict Copyright"
 JAP_strict_copyright_desc: "Copyright is, in practice, binary. A holder either owns the rights to their work or they own nothing. Intellectual property is a serious issue in the 21st century, not only for domestic concerns but international patent theft as well. If we are not strict in enforcing copyright law, then it will be abused."
 JAP_national_network: "Integrated Inter-Network"
 JAP_national_network_desc: "The internet is a tool- one of great opportunity, but also one of extreme danger. We must treat it like any other territorial domain: as a critical area of Japan's national security. The average domestic user will hardly notice any change, but criminals, terrorists, and foreign agents will be foiled by a comprehensive national subnet."
 JAP_new_generation: "A New Generation"
 JAP_new_generation_desc: "The world is changing, and Japan must change with it if its people are to thrive. Whether the Western-aligned principles are correct or if Japan must take a new trajectory is unclear, but we must open our culture up to the possibility of change, or change will tear apart our inflexibility."
 JAP_counter_tiger_mothers: "Combat the Kyōiku Mama"
 JAP_counter_tiger_mothers_desc: "\"Tiger Parents\" who put unrealistic expectations on their children are a symptom of a narrowing society, where success is only recognized by the pinnacle of achievement. This unrealistic expectation placed on youths in a stagnant market is destroying an entire generation. We do not want to be like Korea or China, so we must encourage the middle-achievers."
 JAP_dori_edu: "Dōri Principle"
 JAP_dori_edu_desc: "The time of ducking one's head and accepting irrationality is over. If Japan is to advance into the 21st century, it must have talented and driven youths that are willing to speak when their heart questions why something nonsensical is holding back progress."
 JAP_evolving_conservatism: "Evolving Conservatism"
 JAP_evolving_conservatism_desc: "Japan is changing, whether the old generation likes it or not. If we are to control the manner in which Japan changes, we must seize the hearts of the next generation. Stubbornly digging our heels and looking to the past for answers has failed to inspire the last generation of families and students, we will not make the same mistake."
 JAP_jiko_sekinin: "Jiko-Sekinin Theory"
 JAP_jiko_sekinin_desc: "Coming off of the Lost Decade's impact on society, the idea of \"Self-Responsibility\" must adapt to consider those who fell on hard times at no fault of their own. We need to motivate youths who fear they will be part of the next Lost Generation by sharing some of that responsibility as a society."
 JAP_new_dotoku: "Dōtoku Principle"
 JAP_new_dotoku_desc: "Times change, the world evolves, governments fall, but the heritage of Japan stands above time. The Dōtoku, or moral education, of youth must teach them to honor integrity in themselves and in society. An expectation of moral behavior must come from within, not outside."

 JAP_amaterasu_martian_dawn_desc: "Under the name of Amaterasu, goddess of the rising sun, Japan reaches for the red planet. Long-range probes, advanced propulsion, and pioneering life-support research support a new wave of Martian exploration. Each mission pushes the boundaries of human ingenuity, turning the distant glow of Mars into the next horizon for Japan's high-tech civilization."

 JAP_basic_reconstruction_policy: "Reconstruction Policy"
 JAP_basic_reconstruction_policy_desc: "In the wake of the unprecedented devastation caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, the government must establish a basic policy for reconstruction. Presenting a national framework for restoring livelihoods, rebuilding infrastructure, and revitalizing industry will be the first step toward regaining public trust and stabilizing society."
 JAP_tohoku_infrastructure: "Rebuild Tohoku’s Infrastructure"
 JAP_tohoku_infrastructure_desc: "The earthquake and tsunami dealt catastrophic damage to Tohoku’s transportation networks and lifelines. Rebuilding roads, railways, and ports, is the first step toward restoring local communities and advancing the region’s recovery. Though the effort will demand immense costs and time, it cannot be postponed."
 JAP_fishery_revival: "Agro-Fishery Recovery"
 JAP_fishery_revival_desc: "The tsunami devastated Tohoku’s fishing ports and farmland, destroying countless livelihoods. Rebuilding these sectors will restore the region’s economic base and ensure a stable food supply. This effort is vital to both local recovery and national security."
 JAP_tohoku_port: "Restore Tohoku Port Functions"
 JAP_tohoku_port_desc: "The tsunami crippled port facilities and shipyards, halting logistics and maritime trade. Reconstruction will revive regional industries and reopen key domestic and international routes. Regaining these gateways is essential for Japan’s broader economic recovery."
 JAP_power_supply: "Power Stabilization"
 JAP_power_supply_desc: "The disaster has damaged many power facilities and transmission networks, creating a severe electricity shortage. We must quickly expand alternative sources and reinforce the grid to secure stability for both citizens and industry."
 JAP_kanto_infrastructure: "Rebuild Kanto’s Infrastructure"
 JAP_kanto_infrastructure_desc: "The disaster inflicted severe damage on the Kanto region, particularly in the north, disrupting transportation networks and urban functions. Restoring the infrastructure that supports the capital area is essential for reviving economic activity and maintaining national stability. Swift and well-planned reconstruction is imperative."
 JAP_reconstruction_agency: "Establish Reconstruction Agency"
 JAP_reconstruction_agency_desc: "To accelerate and coordinate post-disaster recovery, the government will establish the Reconstruction Agency. This dedicated body will unify efforts between central and local authorities, ensuring effective implementation of recovery plans."
 JAP_industrial_recovery: "Restore the Industrial Base"
 JAP_industrial_recovery_desc: "The disaster severely damaged factories and industrial facilities. By rebuilding the industrial base, we can restore employment and accelerate the recovery of our economy."
 JAP_funding_local_governments: "Support for Affected Municipalities"
 JAP_funding_local_governments_desc: "Provide funds to local governments in affected areas to support recovery, rebuild livelihoods, and maintain public services."
 JAP_housing_reconstruction: "Rebuilding Housing for Victims"
 JAP_housing_reconstruction_desc: "Accelerate the construction of temporary homes and long-term residential districts, moving displaced families out of shelters and giving towns clear plans for permanent resettlement."
 JAP_reconstruction_completed_focus: "Reconstruction Completed"
 JAP_reconstruction_completed_focus_desc: "Mark the transition from emergency rebuilding to long-term revitalisation across Tōhoku. Core infrastructure is restored, industries are running again, and towns begin shifting from survival to growth."

 JAP_social_reformed: "Reformed Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare"
 JAP_social_reformed_desc: "Restructure the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare to handle Japan's aging society and labour issues more effectively. This focus streamlines overlapping departments, strengthens data-driven policymaking and clarifies responsibility for pensions, healthcare and employment measures."

 JAP_finance_reformed: "Reformed Ministry of Finance"
 JAP_finance_reformed_desc: "The Ministry of Finance undergoes a top-to-bottom reorganisation. Budget and Tax Bureaus are pulled closer together so spending plans and revenue forecasts are written in the same room, the Financial Services Agency gains clearer authority over megabank supervision, and a new debt-management unit is created to track bond issuance in real time. Senior posts are reshuffled away from pure seniority, and policy teams are told to produce multi-year fiscal plans instead of one-year patches."

 JAP_asian_community: "East Asian Community Vision"
 JAP_asian_community_desc: "Revive talk of an East Asian Community built around closer ties between Japan, China, South Korea and ASEAN. Leaders float ideas like looser visa rules and more regular trilateral summits, while officials quietly draft proposals for shared infrastructure funds and regional energy grids that could one day tie the bloc together."
 JAP_eaec: "Revive the East Asia Economic Caucus"
 JAP_eaec_desc: "Pick up old proposals for an East Asia Economic Caucus and give them new life. Tokyo sounds out ASEAN, South Korea and China about coordinating trade positions in WTO talks, standardising rules on investment and quietly using regional meetings to agree common lines before facing the U.S. and Europe."
 JAP_epa: "Economic Partnership Agreement"
 JAP_epa_desc: "Advance negotiations on a broad Economic Partnership Agreement with key Asian partners. Trade officials map out tariff cuts on machinery and autos, simplify rules of origin and press for smoother customs procedures so Japanese exporters and investors face fewer hurdles across the region."
 JAP_eaec_split_candidates: "EAEC Leadership Split"
 JAP_eaec_split_candidates_desc: "As plans for an East Asia Economic Caucus move forward, member states start backing different leaders. Some governments quietly line up behind Tokyo's proposals, while others lean toward Beijing's vision. Diplomats in the region begin counting votes and building blocs before the new forum has even met once."
 JAP_eaec_plus: "EAEC+ Expansion Talks"
 JAP_eaec_plus_desc: "Discuss widening the East Asia Economic Caucus to include partners beyond the original core. ASEAN states suggest India or Australia, while Japan floats adding economies like New Zealand or even the UK to deepen supply-chain resilience. The debate signals an EAEC that could grow into a broader regional bloc rather than a tight, exclusive circle."
 JAP_eaec_pacific: "EAEC Pacific Outreach"
 JAP_eaec_pacific_desc: "Test the idea of stretching the East Asia Economic Caucus across the Pacific. Tokyo quietly sounds out Australia and New Zealand about closer coordination on trade rules and supply chains, hinting that EAEC decisions could one day shape standards far beyond East Asia itself."
 JAP_community_relations: "Improve Intra-Community Relations"
 JAP_community_relations_desc: "Encourage smoother cooperation among EAEC members by expanding working groups on trade, energy and transport. Officials iron out minor disputes, harmonise standards where possible and promote regular minister-level meetings so the bloc operates with fewer frictions and surprises."
 JAP_community_unity: "Support Divided Nations"
 JAP_community_unity_desc: "Use the East Asian framework to quietly back dialogue in divided nations. Japanese diplomats support inter-Korean projects and cross-strait economic contacts, arguing inside the bloc that long-term stability depends on giving separated societies ways to talk, trade and travel even while political disputes remain unresolved."
 JAP_community_confederations: "Support Future Confederations"
 JAP_community_confederations_desc: "Float the idea inside East Asian forums that some divided nations might one day adopt loose confederation models instead of immediate reunification. Japanese envoys quietly back studies on shared currencies, customs zones and joint administrative bodies, arguing that gradual institutional links could ease tensions and make any future political settlement less risky for the region."
 JAP_community_development: "East Asia Development Fund"
 JAP_community_development_desc: "Propose an East Asia Development Fund to finance ports, power grids and rail links across member states. Tokyo offers seed money and JICA expertise, expecting joint projects in poorer regions to bind the bloc together and give Japanese firms a natural role in building the new infrastructure."
 JAP_community_corruption: "Community Anti-Corruption Watch"
 JAP_community_corruption_desc: "Push for an anti-corruption watchdog inside the East Asian framework. Member states agree to share blacklists of banned contractors, publish more details on funded projects and allow mixed audit teams to inspect suspicious tenders. Firms that get caught rigging bids in one country find doors closing across the whole bloc."
 JAP_community_energy: "East Asia Energy Network"
 JAP_community_energy_desc: "Promote shared energy solutions inside the East Asian framework. Officials study cross-border power cables and gas pipelines, compare LNG and renewables plans, and begin sketching a regional grid where surplus from one member can help cover shortages in another."
 JAP_epa_economics: "Integrated Regional Economies"
 JAP_epa_economics_desc: "Use new Economic Partnership Agreements to weave East Asian economies more tightly together. Tariffs come down on key goods, customs procedures are aligned and investment rules are simplified so factories, parts and capital can move more easily across borders."
 JAP_epa_autonomy: "Sovereign Economic Autonomy"
 JAP_epa_autonomy_desc: "Write Economic Partnership Agreements so deeper integration does not erase local control. Clauses on tax, labour and environmental rules are drafted to respect each country's sovereign choices, and room is left for special autonomous regions or zones to tailor implementation without blocking the overall deal."
 JAP_asian_union: "Towards an Asian Union"
 JAP_asian_union_desc: "Float a long-term vision of an Asian Union that goes beyond trade deals and loose forums. Policy papers in Tokyo sketch ideas for shared institutions, freer movement of people and tighter coordination on currency and defence, hinting that today's agreements could one day grow into a political community spanning the region."
 JAP_global_community: "Global Community Vision"
 JAP_global_community_desc: "Recast Japan's role as a builder of global rules rather than a quiet follower. Diplomats push harder inside the UN, G7 and G20 on climate, digital governance and development, and Tokyo offers to host regular ministerial meetings that bring Asian, European and American officials into the same room to talk through shared crises instead of trading statements from afar."
 JAP_dca: "Development Cooperation Charter"
 JAP_dca_desc: "Update Japan's Development Cooperation Charter so aid, trade and security policy point in the same direction. MOFA and JICA rewrite guidelines to prioritise “quality growth,” rule of law and maritime security, tying yen loans and technical projects more tightly to partners that share Japan's interests and values."
 JAP_dca_intern: "Expand the Intern Training Program"
 JAP_dca_intern_desc: "Broaden the Technical Intern Training Program under the Development Cooperation Charter. More slots are opened for trainees from Southeast Asia, and partner governments receive funds to improve language screening and pre-departure training. Companies in Japan gain clearer oversight rules, aiming to turn the scheme from cheap labour into a more credible skills-transfer pathway."
 JAP_dca_foreign_labor: "Foreign Worker Exchange Agreements"
 JAP_dca_foreign_labor_desc: "Use the Development Cooperation Charter to sign worker exchange agreements with selected partner countries. Ministries match ageing Japanese industries with surplus labour abroad, set caps and skill lists, and require employers to provide language support and monitored housing. In return, sending states receive training guarantees and remittance schemes that feed money back into their own development plans."
 JAP_dca_investments: "Adventurous Development Investments"
 JAP_dca_investments_desc: "Allow Japan's development banks to take bolder stakes in high-risk, high-impact projects abroad under the Development Cooperation Charter. JBIC and JICA are encouraged to back ports, power grids and digital networks in frontier markets where private finance hesitates, trading safer returns for greater political influence and long-term economic ties."
 JAP_dca_bankers: "Global Development Bankers"
 JAP_dca_bankers_desc: "Push Japanese banks deeper into development finance under the Development Cooperation Charter. JBIC and megabanks like MUFG and Mizuho are encouraged to co-finance infrastructure and climate projects with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, turning Tokyo's lenders into visible players in global development deals instead of quiet backers in the background."
 JAP_dca_malacca: "Malacca Strait Shipping Talks"
 JAP_dca_malacca_desc: "Open talks with Singapore and Malaysia on how Japan's larger LNG carriers and container ships will move through the Malacca Strait in coming decades. Port upgrades at Singapore and Port Klang, new traffic separation schemes and joint funding for navigation aids are put on the table under the Development Cooperation Charter so vital shipping lanes stay open as vessels grow in size."
 JAP_dca_islands: "Develop Key Economic Islands"
 JAP_dca_islands_desc: "Channel Development Cooperation Charter funds into upgrading economically important islands such as Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. Projects focus on ports, tourism infrastructure and renewable energy so these remote territories can support trade, research and regional connectivity."
 JAP_dca_expand: "Expand the Development Cooperation Charter"
 JAP_dca_expand_desc: "Broaden the Development Cooperation Charter so it covers more partners and sectors. New guidelines add digital infrastructure, climate adaptation and maritime security to the list of priority fields, and embassies receive wider authority to propose projects that match Japan's strategic interests as well as local needs."

 #Monarchist
 JAP_restore_imperial_household: "Restore the Imperial Household"
 JAP_restore_imperial_household_desc: "For decades, the Imperial Household has been confined to ceremony, revered, yet separated from the levers of state. We will reverse that settlement by restoring institutional capacity and a formal role for the court in national administration. This is not pageantry, but a reordering of legitimacy that will force every faction to choose its side when the Chrysanthemum Throne steps forward."
 JAP_reinstate_former_imperial_houses: "Reinstate the Former Imperial Houses"
 JAP_reinstate_former_imperial_houses_desc: "The Imperial institution cannot endure on symbolism alone. Its future depends on continuity, stability, and a secure line of succession. We will reinstate the former imperial houses and restore their status within the national framework, expanding the pool of eligible branches tied to the Throne. This decision will be hailed as safeguarding tradition by monarchists and condemned as political engineering by constitutionalists."
 JAP_male_line_succession_act: "Pass the Male-Line Succession Act"
 JAP_male_line_succession_act_desc: "Succession uncertainty is a strategic vulnerability as much as a domestic controversy. We will codify male-line succession in statute to eliminate ambiguity and secure dynastic continuity for generations to come. The move will consolidate monarchist support, but it will ignite fierce opposition from reformers who see it as a step back from modern Japan."
 JAP_imperial_rites_restored: "Restore the Imperial Rites"
 JAP_imperial_rites_restored_desc: "A throne without ritual is a crown without weight. We will restore the Imperial rites as state-recognized ceremonies, reaffirming the sacred foundations of the monarchy and the continuity of the nation. In doing so, we bind the modern state to ancient legitimacy—whether the political class approves or not."
 JAP_recall_privy_council: "Recall the Privy Council"
 JAP_recall_privy_council_desc: "Parliamentary politics has become loud, transient, and increasingly detached from long-term statecraft. We will recall the Privy Council to provide the Throne with a permanent advisory body, discreet, experienced, and loyal to the continuity of the state. Its return will be seen as a stabilizing anchor by monarchists and as an unelected power center by its opponents."
 JAP_imperial_reform_commission: "Establish the Imperial Reform Commission"
 JAP_imperial_reform_commission_desc: "Restoration demands structure, not improvisation. We will establish an Imperial Reform Commission to draft the legal and institutional blueprint for a renewed monarchy and to align ministries, court offices, and security organs behind a single doctrine of state. Once convened, the commission will turn symbolism into policy and make retreat politically impossible."
 JAP_imperial_audience: "Hold an Imperial Audience"
 JAP_imperial_audience_desc: "The parties will be summoned not as equals, but as petitioners before the Throne. In a carefully staged Imperial Audience, we will bind faction leaders to a new order, one where elected politics serves, rather than commands, the state. If the Chrysanthemum Throne is to preside over a modern shogunate, it must first make the political class bow to its logic."
 JAP_imperial_civic_oath: "Proclaim the Imperial Civic Oath"
 JAP_imperial_civic_oath_desc: "A new order requires more than decrees; it requires shared allegiance. We will proclaim an Imperial Civic Oath that binds officials, servicemembers, and civil institutions to the Throne as the ultimate source of legitimacy. In doing so, we turn loyalty into law and make dissent feel like betrayal."
 JAP_unified_intelligence_secretariat: "Create a Unified Intelligence Secretariat"
 JAP_unified_intelligence_secretariat_desc: "A modern shogunate cannot be blind. We will consolidate competing services into a Unified Intelligence Secretariat that reports through a single chain of command and safeguards the Throne's strategic picture. This will sharpen our statecraft overnight, while giving our rivals every reason to fear what the court now knows."
 JAP_blue_water_navy: "Build a Blue-Water Navy"
 JAP_blue_water_navy_desc: "Japan's destiny is maritime, and our security cannot end at the horizon. We will build a true blue-water navy able to operate far from home waters, protect sea lanes, and project power where our interests demand. With the fleet as the Throne's steel instrument, the world will learn to measure Japan by the wake it leaves behind."
 JAP_imperial_defense_council: "Form the Imperial Defense Council"
 JAP_imperial_defense_council_desc: "Strategy cannot be left to electoral cycles and ministerial rivalry. We will form an Imperial Defense Council to unify the armed forces, intelligence leadership, and key ministries under a single strategic doctrine anchored to the Throne. In one stroke, Japan's security policy becomes coherent and far harder for factions to sabotage from within."
 JAP_rare_earth_resilience: "Secure Rare Earth Resilience"
 JAP_rare_earth_resilience_desc: "A great power can be strangled without a single shot fired by cutting the materials its industry cannot replace. We will secure rare earth resilience through stockpiles, diversified supply, and strategic extraction partnerships, insulating Japan from coercion. If the world wants to pressure us, it will have to find a different lever."
 JAP_national_shipbuilding_plan: "Imperial Fleet Expansion Programme"
 JAP_national_shipbuilding_plan_desc: "The Throne will not settle for coastal defense; Japan will command the seas that decide our fate. Under the Imperial Fleet Expansion Programme, we will surge shipyard capacity, lock in long-term naval procurement, and drive a continuous build cycle from keel-laying to commissioning. When this plan is underway, our rivals will not debate Japan's intentions they will count our hulls."
 JAP_imperial_war_cabinet: "Convene the Imperial War Cabinet"
 JAP_imperial_war_cabinet_desc: "In times of crisis, Japan cannot be governed by delay, committee, and partisan bargaining. We will convene an Imperial War Cabinet to centralize command authority and bind the political leadership to a single strategic line under the Throne's mandate. From this moment, the state will act with one voice and it will be the Emperor's."
 JAP_russian_lost_territories: "Reclaim the Northern Territories"
 JAP_russian_lost_territories_desc: "The wounds of the north have never closed only been covered by treaties and silence. We will press our claim to the islands and waters taken under Russian control, not as a plea, but as a sovereign demand backed by leverage and preparedness. If Moscow will not return what was lost, then Japan must decide how far it is willing to go to take it back."
 JAP_reclaim_pacific_rim: "Assert Our Pacific Rim Mandate"
 JAP_reclaim_pacific_rim_desc: "Japan's prosperity and security are written across the Pacific, from sea lanes to island chains and distant chokepoints. We will assert a Pacific Rim mandate that treats maritime influence as national policy backed by fleet presence, basing access, and economic leverage. The era of watching others draw the map is over; Japan will shape it."
 JAP_office_for_colonialism: "Revive the Daitōa-shō"
 JAP_office_for_colonialism_desc: "An empire without administration is a conquest that collapses under its own weight. We will revive the Daitōa-shō to coordinate overseas governance, security arrangements, and economic integration under a single imperial doctrine. With one ministry to direct the sphere, Japan's influence will no longer be improvised, it will be managed, expanded, and enforced."

 ##Japanese Events

 #Leader Change Event
 japan_classic.15.t: "Keizō Obuchi suffers stroke"
 japan_classic.15.d: "Keizō Obuchi, a loyal servant of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japanese people, had been Prime Minister of Japan since July 30th, 1998 after the resignation of Ryūtarō Hashimoto after the LDP lost the Upper House election of 1998.\nKeizō Obuchi has been described as calm, qualified and efficient - but few people saw his sudden health drop coming. On April 1st, 2000, Obuchi suffered a stroke and was rushed to a hospital."
 japan_classic.15.o1: "Let's hope for the best."
 japan_classic.16.t: "Yoshirō Mori Assumes Office as Prime Minister"
 japan_classic.16.d: "Following the stroke suffered by then-Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi, senior members of the Liberal Democratic Party convened a closed-door meeting of five key figures and selected Yoshirō Mori as his successor in order to avoid a power vacuum.\n\nThe transition took place without any formal explanation to the public, prompting a wave of criticism from the public accusing the government of “backroom politics” and “excluding the people from leadership decisions.” As a result, the Mori administration faced strong headwinds from the very start.\n\nAll eyes are now on Yoshirō Mori’s leadership and whether he can regain the public’s trust."
 japan_classic.16.o1: "Avoiding a power vacuum was the only priority."
 #Historic Flavor Event
 japan_classic.18.t: "Yoshirō Mori's political gaffe"
 japan_classic.18.d: "On May 15th, 2000, newly elected Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori got into major negative headlines for the first time when he publicly referred to Japan as \"a Divine Nation centered on the Emperor\". This, in the eyes of both the opposition and the ruling LDP, calls the democratic ideals of Japan as well as the role of the monarchy into question.\nPublic approval ratings of the Prime Minister have dropped."
 japan_classic.18.o1: "What a fool!"
 japan_classic.18.o2: "Double down on his statements."
 Japan.3.t: "The Dawn of a New Era"
 Japan.3.d: "The Emperor, the symbol of Japan, is abdicating and a new Emperor is ascending the throne—an exceptionally rare national turning point in modern Japan. With Emperor Akihito’s abdication, Crown Prince Naruhito will ascend as the 126th Emperor, and the era name will be renewed.\n\nSeveral years ago, Emperor Akihito’s words about his duties came as a surprise to many people. At first, shock and uncertainty spread, but through debate and the necessary procedures, preparations for the ceremonies steadily moved forward.\n\nAnd now, after solemn rites, the “Heisei” era comes to an end and “Reiwa” begins. The political system will not change directly. However, the nation’s atmosphere will clearly shift, likely influencing social cohesion and public expectations of the government."
 Japan.3.a: "Let us quietly welcome the new era."
 #China’s National Focus Event
 Japan.8.t: "China is Demanding the Senkaku Islands!"
 Japan.8.d: "China has revived their dispute with us over ownership of the Senkaku islands. If we give in to their demands we might increase China's confidence in its ability to influence our foreign policy as well as reduce our popularity among the more nationalistic of our people. However, the consequences of refusing probably do not bode well for us either."
 Japan.8.a: "Let them have their fishing rights..."
 Japan.8.b: "Japan will not be intimidated!"
 Japan.4.t: "Japan has Handed Over the Islands!"
 Japan.4.d: "Clearly accepting the legitimacy of our claim, Japan has returned the Senkaku islands to us, their rightful owner."
 Japan.4.a: "Perhaps the Japanese have some sense after all!"
 Japan.5.t: "Japan Remains Defiant!"
 Japan.5.d: "The Japanese are clearly as determined to remain our mortal enemies as ever."
 Japan.5.a: "They will regret this..."
 Japan.6.t: "Chinese jets have fired on the aircraft we scrambled to intercept them!"
 Japan.6.d: "Our fighters regularly respond to Chinese incursions into our air space, normally without incident. However this time our fighters were fired upon by the Chinese, resulting in the deaths of several of our pilots and the loss of multiple aircraft. We should evaluate whether this incident, given China's recent actions, was a deliberate provocation or an unfortunate accident and decide our response accordingly."
 Japan.6.a: "We have a right to self-defense!"
 Japan.6.b: "We should call upon our protectors!"
 Japan.6.c: "This was probably an accident..."
 Japan.7.t: "Chinese and Japanese Fighter Jets Engage in Aerial Combat"
 Japan.7.d: "The East China Sea has erupted into conflict following a confrontation between Chinese and Japanese aircraft. The clash reportedly began when Japanese jets were scrambled to intercept Chinese fighters over Japanese airspace. Rather than resulting in a Chinese retreat which has historically occurred after similar incidents, Japanese aircraft were fired upon, resulting in the deaths of several Japanese pilots and the loss of multiple aircraft. [JAP.GetLeader] has strongly condemned the incident and is reportedly engaged in urgent talks behind closed doors regarding Japan's response to this event."
 Japan.7.a: "Is a third Sino-Japanese War on the horizon?"

 JAP_diplomacy.11.t: "U.S. Request to Reinterpret Article 9"
 JAP_diplomacy.11.d: "The government of the United States has approached us with a formal request to further reinterpret Article 9 of our Constitution. Washington argues that the regional security environment has deteriorated to such an extent that Japan must assume a greater share of the collective defense burden. Accepting their request would open the door to a broader understanding of self-defense,and to closer military cooperation, but it will not be without domestic controversy."
 JAP_diplomacy.11.a: "Accept the U.S. request"
 JAP_diplomacy.11.b: "We cannot accept this request"
 JAP_diplomacy.12.t: "Japan Refuses to Reinterpret Article 9"
 JAP_diplomacy.12.d: "Tokyo has informed us that it is not prepared to further reinterpret Article 9 at this time. Concerns over domestic public opinion, constitutional constraints, and political stability have led the Japanese government to reject our request. We must now decide whether to respect their decision or increase diplomatic and security pressure."
 JAP_diplomacy.12.a: "We will respect their decision"
 JAP_diplomacy.12.b: "Increase pressure on Japan"
 JAP_diplomacy.14.t: "U.S. Pressure on Article 9"
 JAP_diplomacy.14.d: "Following our refusal to broaden the interpretation of Article 9, the United States has quietly begun to increase diplomatic and security pressure on our government. Alliance consultations, media briefings, and behind-the-scenes messages all point in the same direction: Washington expects Japan to shoulder more responsibility. We can stand firm or quietly shift our stance."
 JAP_diplomacy.14.a: "We will stand firm"
 JAP_diplomacy.14.b: "Quietly adjust our position"
 JAP_diplomacy.15.t: "Japan Accepts Under Pressure"
 JAP_diplomacy.15.d: "After a period of heightened diplomatic and strategic pressure, Tokyo has indicated that it is prepared to move closer to our position on Article 9. While publicly insisting that Japan's pacifist principles remain unchanged, the government has now broadened its self-defense interpretation in a manner that aligns with our expectations."
 JAP_diplomacy.15.a: "Excellent"
 JAP_diplomacy.17.t: "U.S. Tariffs on Japanese Goods"
 JAP_diplomacy.17.d: "The United States has announced a new package of tariffs targeting key Japanese exports, citing economic imbalances and domestic political pressure. The measures are presented as a way to 'level the playing field,' but in Tokyo they are widely seen as a politically motivated move that will strain both our economy and the broader alliance."
 JAP_diplomacy.17.a: "We will have to adapt to this new reality"
 JAP_diplomacy.18.t: "Japan Requests Tariff Relief"
 JAP_diplomacy.18.d: "Tokyo has formally requested that we lift the tariffs imposed on Japanese goods. Japanese representatives hint that their government may be willing to deepen security cooperation and move further on defense policy in exchange. We must decide whether to turn this economic dispute into a strategic opportunity, or maintain the pressure."
 JAP_diplomacy.18.a: "Lift the tariffs in exchange for security concessions"
 JAP_diplomacy.18.b: "Refuse and keep the tariffs in place"
 JAP_diplomacy.19.t: "Tariffs Lifted, Security Concessions Demanded"
 JAP_diplomacy.19.d: "The United States has agreed to lift its tariffs on Japanese exports, but only as part of a broader understanding on security and defense. In practice, this means that Japan is expected to further broaden the interpretation of Article 9, deepening military cooperation with Washington and taking on a larger role in regional security."
 JAP_diplomacy.19.a: "For our economy and our alliance, we will accept this burden"
 JAP_diplomacy.20.t: "U.S. Refuses to Lift Tariffs"
 JAP_diplomacy.20.d: "Our formal request to lift the U.S. tariffs has been rejected. Washington insists that the measures will remain in place, citing domestic political pressures and unresolved disagreements over security policy. At home, frustration is growing among exporters and business leaders, while strategists warn that the dispute could further complicate our alliance."
 JAP_diplomacy.20.a: "We will have to endure the pressure for now"
 JAP_diplomacy.21.t: "Japan Requests Renewed Security Guarantees"
 JAP_diplomacy.21.d: "The Japanese government has formally requested renewed or strengthened security guarantees from the United States. Tokyo argues that the regional security environment has deteriorated and that a clearer U.S. commitment would help stabilize the situation. In private, Japanese officials acknowledge that further changes to the interpretation of Article 9 may be possible if Washington is prepared to make explicit commitments."
 JAP_diplomacy.21.a: "Restore our security guarantees in exchange for deeper commitments"
 JAP_diplomacy.21.b: "Refuse to extend our guarantees"
 JAP_diplomacy.22.t: "Security Guarantees Restored"
 JAP_diplomacy.22.d: "The United States has agreed to renew and clarify its security guarantees to Japan. In return, Washington expects Tokyo to take further steps in broadening the interpretation of Article 9 and assuming a greater share of regional security responsibilities. The alliance grows stronger, but the domestic debate over our pacifist principles will intensify."
 JAP_diplomacy.22.a: "For our security, we will accept this commitment"
 JAP_diplomacy.23.t: "U.S. Refuses Stronger Guarantees"
 JAP_diplomacy.23.d: "Our request for renewed or strengthened security guarantees has been rejected. The United States insists that existing arrangements are sufficient and that domestic political constraints limit any further commitments. Within Japan, this refusal will fuel concerns about our long-term security and the reliability of our alliance."
 JAP_diplomacy.23.a: "Then we must reconsider our own path"
 JAP_diplomacy.24.t: "Japan Requests an End to U.S. Naval Pressure"
 JAP_diplomacy.24.d: "Tokyo has formally requested that we scale back or end our heightened naval presence and pressure around key sea lanes and chokepoints. Japanese officials argue that the current posture risks escalation and undermines domestic support for the alliance. In private, they indicate that further changes to the interpretation of Article 9 may be possible if we ease our posture."
 JAP_diplomacy.24.a: "End the naval pressure in exchange for security concessions"
 JAP_diplomacy.24.b: "Maintain our naval pressure around Japan"
 JAP_diplomacy.25.t: "Naval Pressure Eased, Commitments Deepened"
 JAP_diplomacy.25.d: "The United States has agreed to ease its heightened naval presence around our sea lanes, in return for deeper security commitments from Japan. In practice, this means another step in broadening the interpretation of Article 9 and expanding our role in regional security. The alliance appears stronger, but the domestic debate over our pacifist identity will only grow more intense."
 JAP_diplomacy.25.a: "For the sake of stability, we will honor this deal"
 JAP_diplomacy.26.t: "U.S. Refuses to End Naval Pressure"

With his youth, name recognition, political lineage, and symbolic status as the “post-Koizumi” figure, he was gathering broad support from across the party.\n\nWho is better suited to steer the nation forward—an experienced incumbent or a new leader ready to carry the torch into the next generation?

In later Diet sessions, he further refused to elaborate, stating, “Under the system, no further explanation is required.”\n\nOpposition parties strongly criticized the situation, calling it a potential “false statement” and “abuse of the system,” while public distrust grew over the government's overall accountability."

 mdmosjap_japan.161023001.d: "5:56 PM, October 23, 2004 - A magnitude 6.8 and scale 7 earthquake occured in Niigata. It was first time to record JMA Scale 7 since the revision by the 1995's Hanshin Earthquake. In Yamakoshi, all of roads had been destroyed by the landslides and every residents were locked in the village. A train had being run on the Joetsu Shinkansen Line got derailed by the shock but no one killed. However, as a result of the quake, 68 were killed."

 mdmosjap_japan.170320001.d: "10:53 AM, March 20, 2005 - A magnitude 7.0 and scale 6- earthquake occured in off Fukuoka City. There is less records of earthquakes in Northern Kyushu and this one was also largest one since 1922. In Genkai Island of Fukuoka City, about 700 peoples have evacuated and ten decided to remain for disaster communication and patrol. In Central of Fukuoka, most of windows are broken and these fragments fell into the pavement and injured two pedestrians. The earthquake shook not only Tsushima but also Korea and China. One people was killed by the quake."

 mdmosjap_japan.170425001.d: "At 9:18 AM on April 25, 2005, a rapid-service train on JR West’s Fukuchiyama Line (also known as the JR Takarazuka Line) derailed at a sharp curve in Amagasaki City, Hyogo Prefecture, and crashed into the first floor of a nearby apartment building.\nThe train had seven cars, though initial reports mistakenly claimed it had only six, as the lead car had become completely embedded in the building. Investigation revealed that the train had entered the curve at approximately 116 km/h (72 mph), despite the section’s speed limit being 70 km/h (43 mph). The excessive speed likely caused the derailment due to centrifugal force.\nFThe driver was killed in the accident, but testimony from the conductor in the rear car suggested that the crew may have been attempting to make up for a delay of about 90 seconds. It was later reported that strict internal disciplinary measures existed within the company for even minor operational errors. These measures included re-education sessions, copying company rules by hand, and other corrective practices that had origins dating back to the privatization of the Japanese National Railways (JNR) during the Nakasone administration.\nFortunately, a limited express train approaching from the opposite direction was able to make an emergency stop due to the blocked track, avoiding a secondary collision. However, as the accident occurred during the morning rush hour, the train was crowded. In total, 107 people were killed and 562 were injured, making this the deadliest railway accident in postwar Japanese history.Some medical specialists noted that several passengers may not have died immediately in the crash but later due to crush syndrome resulting from prolonged compression."

He, the first-born Imperial Prince in the third millennium, was named Hisahito which means \"Hisa\" as \"In a relaxed manner\" and \"Hito\" as the Imperial naming tradition from the Heian era. He was delivered by the Caesarian section at the private hospital, not in the Imperial Palace; both were first time of the Imperial history. This was welcomed as the legitimated male of the succession of the Imperial throne as well as the birth of new Imperial family. Following the birth of the boy, the arguement of amendment the Imperial Household Law has been quieting down little by little."

 mdmosjap_japan.190216001.d: "In 1997, Japan's Social Insurance Agency (SIA) began consolidating individual pension records under a single “Basic Pension Number” system. However, between 2006 and 2007, the agency discovered approximately 50 million pension records that remained unlinked or had discrepancies due to errors during the transcription of paper documents into digital format.\nSome of these missing records affected current pension recipients, raising concerns that individuals may have received incorrect payment amounts. Additionally, certain records were reportedly lost or mistakenly deleted during attempts to update employee pension data.\nIn response, [JAP.GetRulingParty] launched a special task force to investigate the issue and proposed emergency legislation to provide relief to those affected. Nevertheless, opposition parties are harshly criticizing the government, and public dissatisfaction remains high."

The JMA scale calculated the quake as 6+ at Wajima City, Ishikawa Prefecture, and it was the first strongest earthquake since the seismic observation started in 1922. The hypocentre is reported to place in the area where any researches did not find a fault as yet. The tremor reached from Hokkaido Prefecture to Kochi Prefecture caused 20cm (7.87 inches) of the tsunami.

The JMA scale calculates 6+ in several towns, but at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, it was unofficially computed as 7. The tsunami also caused by the tremor and was recorded at 1m (3.28 ft) in Kashiwazaki City. The earthquake killed 15 people directly and secondarily, injured 2346 people and damaged more than 34,000 buildings includes 1,331 destroyed houses. The fire breaks out at the previously mentioned Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, but the extinguish was delayed two hours due to the mistake of communication sharing on the early-stage fire fighting, which caused radioactive leakage though it was within the environmentally ignorable level. This earthquake has occurred only 4 months later from the Noto Earthquake and 3 years later from the destructive 2004 Niigata Chuetsu Earthquake."

The JMA Scale calculated the earthquake 6- in many areas of Shizuoka Prefecture, 8678 houses and several historic buildings are damaged, but nothing of houses were completely slammed. The Tokai region, where includes Shizuoka Prefecture, is the estimated crucial disastrous area of the future Great Tokai-Tonankai Earthquake and Tsunami, so the residents have prepared by the evacuation drill, stabilising their own furniture and strengthening their houses and buildings. That was the reason for fewer victims and damages compared to its scale of the earthquake. Nevertheless, there were reports of damage in the factories, tea plantations, and Tomei Expressway."

His approval ratings had declined, and the disconnect between him and the public—symbolized by his “divine nation” remark and his handling of the Ehime Maru incident—had only grown wider.\n\nElected as his successor in the LDP leadership race was Junichiro Koizumi, who captured national attention with his bold declaration to “destroy the LDP” and ran a flashy, high-profile campaign. Public expectations were high, and he won a landslide victory in the regional vote.\n\nWith a style and stage presence that broke away from the old Liberal Democratic Party, Koizumi raised the banner of \"reform\" as he assumed the office of Prime Minister.\n\nHowever, what might emerge from the ruins he vowed to destroy—no one yet knows."

By unifying advanced projects under a single strategic vision, Japan accelerates innovation, reduces duplication, and ensures that cutting-edge technologies reach frontline units faster."
 JAP_JP_USA_SOFA_1: "U.S.-Japan SOFA Framework"
 JAP_JP_USA_SOFA_1_desc: "U.S. forces in Japan operate under a Status of Forces Agreement that shields most personnel from Japanese courts and taxes, and gives the U.S. wide control over its bases. Local police, governors and residents must work around rules negotiated in Washington and Tokyo, and every crime, accident or noise complaint near a base is filtered through SOFA procedures before Japan can act."
 JAP_depopulation_0: "Demographic Strain (Contained)"
 JAP_depopulation_0_desc: "Japan's population is aging and shrinking, but the pace is still manageable. Schools merge quietly, rural towns struggle to fill jobs, yet big cities remain crowded and the pension system holds together with gradual adjustments."
 JAP_depopulation_1: "Demographic Crisis (Emerging)"
 JAP_depopulation_1_desc: "Birth rates stay low and the working-age population is visibly thinning. Shopping streets in smaller cities lose tenants, local hospitals report staff shortages, and ministries quietly admit that existing pension and care formulas no longer add up."
 JAP_depopulation_2: "Demographic Crisis (Serious)"
 JAP_depopulation_2_desc: "Whole neighbourhoods slip into semi-abandonment and municipalities in Tōhoku, Shikoku and Hokkaidō struggle to keep schools, bus lines and clinics open. The tax base erodes faster than expected, and every new budget round is a fight over how to fund basic services."
 JAP_depopulation_3: "Demographic Crisis (Severe)"
 JAP_depopulation_3_desc: "Japan's demographic slide is now the defining fact of public life. Prefectures shut down entire hospital wings, police and fire coverage are stretched thin, and companies in logistics, care and construction cannot find enough workers even with generous offers."
 JAP_depopulation_4: "Demographic Collapse (Out of Control)"
 JAP_depopulation_4_desc: "Population decline has moved beyond policy control. Large swathes of the countryside are effectively depopulated, urban infrastructure runs below capacity, and the state struggles to maintain pensions and long-term care. Every ministry treats demographic damage control as its main task."
 JAP_demographics_finished: "Demographic Crisis Resolved"
 JAP_demographics_finished_desc: "Japan has stabilised its population problem. Birth rates have recovered or long-term migration has filled the gap, and the age structure has settled into a sustainable pattern. Schools, hospitals and pension funds plan on steady numbers again instead of preparing for endless decline."
 JAP_bubble_burst: "Heisei Bubble Aftermath"
 JAP_bubble_burst_desc: "Japan is still shaped by the deflated asset bubble of the early 1990s. Land prices remain far below their peak, banks carry long memories of bad loans, and companies prefer hoarding cash over risky investment. The slow-growth habits formed during the Heisei recession continue to guide business decisions and government policy alike."
 JAP_welfare_reform_bad: "Strained Welfare Reform"
 JAP_welfare_reform_bad_desc: "Japan's welfare system is stuck in a difficult transition. Eligibility checks have tightened, benefits lag behind living costs, and local offices struggle to process rising numbers of elderly and low-income cases. Public trust erodes as reforms meant to stabilise the system instead leave many households feeling exposed."
 JAP_peoples_lives_first: "People's Lives First"
 JAP_peoples_lives_first_desc: "Budget choices and cabinet messaging put everyday living standards ahead of abstract fiscal targets. Increases in pensions, child benefits and medical subsidies are protected even when other programmes are trimmed, and ministries are told to justify policies in terms of wages, rent and household bills rather than macroeconomic charts."
 JAP_one_nation: "One Society"
 JAP_one_nation_desc: "Japan is governed with an emphasis on social cohesion over sharp class or regional divisions. Major parties still argue, but policy debates assume a shared middle ground, and appeals to harmony and stability carry more weight than calls for open confrontation."
 JAP_keidanren_influence: "Keidanren Influence"
 JAP_keidanren_influence_desc: "Big business, organised through Keidanren, holds a strong voice in policymaking. Tax, trade and labour proposals are routinely run past its committees first, and cabinet ministers treat its policy papers as informal guidelines for Japan's economic course."
 JAP_abenomics: "Three Arrows of Abenomics"
 JAP_abenomics_desc: "Economic policy is organised around Abenomics' three arrows: aggressive monetary easing, flexible fiscal spending and structural reform. The Bank of Japan keeps rates ultra-low, public works and subsidies support demand, and ministries push gradual deregulation in selected sectors."
 JAP_work_style_reform: "Work Style Reform Drive"
 JAP_work_style_reform_desc: "Work style reform is reshaping offices and factories. Legal caps on overtime are in force, telework rules are being tested, and companies are pushed to convert some non-regular staff to regular contracts, even as old habits of long hours and face time remain hard to break."
 JAP_worker_relief: "Worker Relief Measures"
 JAP_worker_relief_desc: "Extra relief measures cushion workers facing low wages and unstable contracts. Expanded housing aid, retraining subsidies and emergency loans keep many households afloat, buying time for people caught between rising living costs and uncertain employment."
 JAP_legislated_flexibility: "Legislated Labour Flexibility"
 JAP_legislated_flexibility_desc: "Labour law now leans toward flexibility. Discretionary and performance-based contracts are easier to use, fixed-term and part-time arrangements are more common, and firms can adjust staffing more quickly—at the cost of weaker job security for many workers."
 JAP_temp_staff: "Temporary Staffing Breakthrough"
 JAP_temp_staff_desc: "Temporary staffing agencies have become a central pillar of Japan's labour market. Offices, factories and call centres rely heavily on dispatched workers whose contracts can be renewed or dropped with little notice, giving employers agility but entrenching a two-tier workforce."
 JAP_subsidy_baby_boom: "Baby Boom Subsidy Push"
 JAP_subsidy_baby_boom_desc: "Generous child allowances, tuition support and childcare subsidies are in place to push back against falling birth rates. Young couples see more financial help with pregnancy, nursery fees and schooling, and local governments compete with bonus payments to attract families."
 JAP_adoption_wave: "Adoption Wave"
 JAP_adoption_wave_desc: "Domestic adoption is quietly rising. More couples choose to take in children from foster care, prefectures run active matching programmes, and courts process cases faster, giving otherwise institutionalised children a realistic path into family life."
 JAP_immigration1: "Relaxed Immigration"
 JAP_immigration1_desc: "Immigration rules are looser than in the past. Work and study visas are easier to obtain and renew, more long-term residents settle in Japanese cities, and foreign neighbourhoods around major stations are becoming a normal part of urban life."
 JAP_immigration2: "Surveilled Relaxed Immigration"
 JAP_immigration2_desc: "Immigration is more open on paper but tightly watched in practice. Foreign workers and residents face frequent ID checks, detailed address registration and expanded data sharing between ministries, keeping numbers up while maintaining a constant sense of surveillance."
 JAP_foreign_worker_legislation1: "Foreign Workers Framework"
 JAP_foreign_worker_legislation1_desc: "A dedicated legal framework now governs foreign workers. Quotas, skill categories and employer obligations are clearly defined, allowing factories, farms and care homes to rely on overseas labour without improvising around old trainee schemes."
 JAP_foreign_worker_legislation2: "Naturalisation-Oriented Worker Policy"
 JAP_foreign_worker_legislation2_desc: "Foreign workers follow clearer paths from temporary status to permanent residency and citizenship. Long-term contributors gain easier access to social insurance, family reunification and naturalisation, and some neighbourhoods now see second-generation residents who speak Japanese as their first language."
 JAP_japanese_equality: "Japanese Equality Norm"
 JAP_japanese_equality_desc: "Public debate treats full social participation by women, LGBTQ people and minorities as a mainstream expectation rather than a fringe demand. Anti-discrimination language appears in more company rules and local ordinances, and open prejudice draws louder pushback than in previous decades."
 JAP_motivated_feminism: "Motivated Feminism"
 JAP_motivated_feminism_desc: "A motivated feminist current shapes politics and workplaces. Lawsuits over harassment and pay gaps move through the courts, women's groups track statistics on board seats and promotions, and companies with visibly male-only leadership face growing public criticism."
 JAP_artificial_growth: "Artificial Growth Policies"
 JAP_artificial_growth_desc: "Economic expansion rests heavily on government and central bank support. Ultra-low interest rates, stimulus spending and targeted subsidies keep GDP figures in positive territory, even as underlying productivity and demographics would point toward stagnation without constant intervention."
 JAP_authorities_poor: "Weak Oversight Authorities"
 JAP_authorities_poor_desc: "Japan's watchdog agencies are fragmented and underpowered. Audit bodies lack staff, regulators rely on voluntary reports, and serious complaints often vanish into jurisdictional gaps between ministries and commissions."
 JAP_authorities_changing: "Reorganised Oversight Authorities"
 JAP_authorities_changing_desc: "Oversight agencies are in the middle of reorganisation. Old commissions are being merged or rebranded, mandates are rewritten, and staff move between offices while new procedures bed in, leaving supervision uneven from sector to sector."
 JAP_authorities_good: "Effective Oversight Authorities"
 JAP_authorities_good_desc: "Independent watchdogs and regulators are able to check ministries and major corporations with real authority. Audit reports are published, fines bite, and agencies have enough staff and legal tools to make misconduct materially risky."
 JAP_bureau_ombudsman: "Bureaucratic Ombudsman Office"
 JAP_bureau_ombudsman_desc: "Citizens and civil servants can bring complaints about administrative abuse to an ombudsman office outside the normal hierarchy. Patterns of misconduct inside ministries are tracked across cases, and well-documented findings are difficult for senior officials to ignore."
 JAP_bureau_forum: "Civil Service Reform Forum"
 JAP_bureau_forum_desc: "A standing forum of senior officials, outside experts and local-government representatives meets regularly to review how the bureaucracy actually works. Promotion rules, posting practices and performance metrics are debated in public reports instead of decided only behind closed doors."
 JAP_service_shocks: "Service Shockwaves"
 JAP_service_shocks_desc: "Rapid restructuring of public services sends shockwaves through the bureaucracy. Mergers, staff cuts and new performance contracts disrupt long-standing routines, and some offices struggle to keep up with basic paperwork while they adapt."
 JAP_privatization_corp: "Corporatised Public Services"
 JAP_privatization_corp_desc: "Many state functions are now delivered by semi-independent public corporations. Agencies modelled on firms handle rail, utilities and logistics under performance contracts, blurring the line between administration and business while keeping formal ownership in government hands."
 JAP_privatization_full: "Full-Scale Privatisation"
