 JAP_redundant_desc: "Launch a redevelopment programme that clears obsolete factory sites, ageing public buildings and underused urban blocks to make room for modern housing, industry and green space. Areas deemed structurally redundant are surveyed, acquired and rebuilt so that stagnant districts can rejoin Japan's economic and social life."
 JAP_e_japan: "e-Japan Initiative"
 JAP_e_japan_desc: "Unveil a national e-Japan strategy that treats high-speed networks and digital services as core infrastructure. Ministries, schools and hospitals are pushed onto broadband platforms, online procedures replace paper counters, and incentives draw private investment into fibre and mobile networks, aiming to make Japan a leading information society rather than a country of fax machines and aging systems."
 JAP_abolish_privilege: "Abolish Bureaucratic Privilege"
 JAP_abolish_privilege_desc: "Order a full assessment of the hidden privileges enjoyed by senior bureaucrats—special allowances, unofficial perks, reserved housing and closed promotion tracks. Benefits that cannot be justified to the public are earmarked for reduction or abolition, with the aim of turning a culture of entitlement into one of service and accountability."
 JAP_cut_off_salary: "Cut Bureaucrats' Salaries"
 JAP_cut_off_salary_desc: "Announce a cut in senior bureaucrats' salaries and allowances as a visible gesture of restraint from the top of the state. Pay scales for upper ranks are trimmed, bonuses reduced and certain perks cancelled, sending a signal that officials will share in the sacrifices demanded of taxpayers and frontline workers."
 JAP_bureaucracy_amendment: "Bureaucratic Reform Amendment"
 JAP_bureaucracy_amendment_desc: "Table a comprehensive amendment package that rewrites key rules governing Japan's bureaucracy. Promotion criteria are shifted from pure seniority to performance, recruitment is opened more widely, and clear limits are set on secondments and advisory posts, with the aim of turning a closed, hierarchical caste into a more professional, accountable civil service."
 JAP_concessional_water_business: "Water Utility Concession Scheme"
 JAP_concessional_water_business_desc: "Design a concession scheme that allows private operators to run municipal water and sewer systems under strict public contracts. Long-term agreements fix maximum tariffs, set service and quality standards, and require investment in aging pipes and treatment plants, while legal ownership of the infrastructure remains with prefectures and cities."
 JAP_tourism_and_casino: "Integrated Resort Tourism Strategy"
 JAP_tourism_and_casino_desc: "Advance an integrated resort strategy that links large-scale casinos with hotels, convention centres and entertainment districts aimed at foreign visitors. Legalisation is tied to strict licensing, local consultation and dedicated tax channels for regional development and problem-gambling countermeasures."
 JAP_private_social_securities: "Japan Pension Service Private Fund Scheme"
 JAP_private_social_securities_desc: "Allow the Japan Pension Service to channel part of its contributions into privately managed funds under strict caps and guarantees. Large financial institutions are selected to handle diversified investment portfolios, while the core public pension remains intact. The goal is to raise long-term returns on social security assets without abandoning the state's responsibility for a basic, guaranteed benefit."
 JAP_mil_sunrise: "Amaterasu's New Dawn"
 JAP_mil_sunrise_desc: "Frame a new national renewal agenda around the image of Amaterasu, the sun goddess who brings light back to the world. Long-term defence planning, high-end research projects and strategic infrastructure are bundled into a single millennium-scale vision: a Japan that steps out of stagnation and reclaims its place as a technologically advanced, self-reliant guardian of its own islands and sea lanes."
 JAP_dissolve_kisha_club: "Kisha Club Abolition"
 JAP_dissolve_kisha_club_desc: "Break the closed kisha club system by opening government briefings and press rooms to all accredited outlets, including regional papers, foreign media and online platforms. Membership-based exclusivity is abolished, and ministries are instructed to publish schedules, transcripts and background materials so that political reporting no longer depends on a handful of tightly managed press circles."
 JAP_domestic_journalism: "NHK Media Independence"
 JAP_domestic_journalism_desc: "Grant NHK and regional public broadcasters broader editorial freedoms and legal protections against political interference. New safeguards strengthen their right to investigate ministries, question officials openly and report on national affairs without pressure from party factions or bureaucratic gatekeepers. A more autonomous public media sector is expected to raise transparency and restore trust in Japan's political institutions."
 JAP_journalism_solidarity: "Journalism Solidarity Network"
 JAP_journalism_solidarity_desc: "Encourage reporters' unions and newsroom councils to form a cross-outlet solidarity network. Big-city dailies, regional papers and NHK desks agree to share legal support, pool risk on sensitive investigations and back colleagues facing intimidation or lawsuits. Editors know that if one outlet is threatened over a story, others will pick it up instead of quietly dropping it."
 JAP_alpha_influencer: "Alpha Influencer Outreach"
 JAP_alpha_influencer_desc: "Select a group of high-visibility online creators to quietly assist government messaging. Hikakin and Hajime Shachō receive early access to policy announcements so they can frame them in upbeat daily videos, while Kemio is invited to promote youth-oriented campaigns across Instagram and TikTok. Even virtual personalities like Kizuna AI are approached to front PR events and livestream Q&A sessions. When major legislation is introduced, timelines fill instantly with reaction clips, explainers and coordinated hashtags."
 JAP_global_journalism: "NHK World Expansion"
 JAP_global_journalism_desc: "Upgrade NHK World from a niche satellite channel into Japan's main voice abroad. New studios open in London, Singapore and Washington, English-language news bulletins are expanded, and more programmes about Japanese politics, culture and technology are pushed onto streaming platforms and hotel TV packages. Foreign audiences who once only saw Japan during crises now hear its side of trade disputes, security debates and regional diplomacy every day."
 JAP_cultural_export: "Cool Japan Digital Export"
 JAP_cultural_export_desc: "Pour new money into the Cool Japan Fund and push anime studios, game publishers and music labels to chase global streaming audiences. Aniplex and Toei negotiate extra slots on Netflix and Crunchyroll, Sony Music and Avex line up J-pop and idol content for YouTube and TikTok, and VTuber agencies like Hololive and Nijisanji are encouraged to add English and Korean channels. Foreign timelines fill up with Japanese series, clips and livestreams, and tourism ads start riding on the back of every viral opening song and character collab."
 JAP_e_commerce_ease: "E-Commerce Entry Reform"
 JAP_e_commerce_ease_desc: "Lower the barriers for small businesses to enter Japan's major online marketplaces. Rakuten and Yahoo! Shopping simplify registration for new sellers, Amazon Japan expands its fulfilment slots for domestic SMEs, and local governments offer digital onboarding help for rural shops. Family-run bakeries, craft stores and second-hand dealers that once relied on foot traffic can now open nationwide storefronts with a single application."
 JAP_parallel_internet_society: "Parallel Internet Society"
 JAP_parallel_internet_society_desc: "A growing share of the population withdraws from public life into insulated online communities. Anonymous boards like 5ch, algorithm-driven bubbles on Twitter and TikTok, and closed Discord groups start replacing neighbourhood ties and workplace networks. Rumours, fringe ideologies and unverified ‘news' spread faster than official statements, and whole segments of society drift into digital echo chambers that no longer respond to traditional media or political outreach."
 JAP_flexible_copyright: "Flexible Copyright Reform"
 JAP_flexible_copyright_desc: "Loosen copyright enforcement in areas where fan activity already drives Japan's soft power. Anime studios and game publishers publish clear guidelines that allow dōjinshi circles to sell parody books at Comiket, VTubers to stream playthroughs of popular titles, and fan artists to post derivative work on Pixiv and Twitter as long as they follow basic rules. Lawyers still keep control over piracy and commercial knock-offs, but the day-to-day remix culture around big franchises is quietly encouraged instead of threatened."
 JAP_freedom_of_internet: "Open Internet Charter"
 JAP_freedom_of_internet_desc: "The cabinet signs an Open Internet Charter that limits how far ministries and police can reach into online speech. Content takedown requests are narrowed to clear crimes, court warrants are required before providers hand over browsing logs, and vague ‘public order' clauses are stripped from telecom rules. Encrypted messaging apps and independent news sites operate with fewer quiet threats in the background, and internet users begin to speak more freely about politics and scandals."
 JAP_e_commerce_strict: "Regulated Domain Hosting"
 JAP_e_commerce_strict_desc: "The government moves to tighten control over who can run a .jp website. JPRS and major hosting firms like Sakura Internet, Xserver and GMO are ordered to carry out strict identity checks, keep detailed customer records and respond quickly to takedown notices. Small online shops and personal blogs are told to file real-name registration and proof of address before their domains are renewed, and overseas hosts serving Japanese users face new pressure to keep data on servers inside Japan."
 JAP_control_internet_society: "Controlled Internet Sphere"
 JAP_control_internet_society_desc: "Push Japan's online communities into a more tightly managed space through expanded monitoring and behavioural rules. Major platforms like Twitter Japan, LINE and Niconico are pressed to adjust algorithms that amplify anonymous hostility, while police cyber units receive authority to intervene earlier in fringe forums and encrypted groups. Account verification becomes more common, sudden surges of misinformation are throttled at the provider level, and online anonymity slowly gives way to a system where users are expected to remain traceable and compliant."
 JAP_strict_copyright: "Copyright Crackdown"
 JAP_strict_copyright_desc: "Copyright agencies and rights-holders are given far sharper teeth. JASRAC lawyers step up takedown demands against unlicensed music on YouTube and Niconico, manga publishers like Shueisha and Kodansha pour money into hunting scanlation sites, and game companies tighten rules on fan patches and modding. Dōjin events still run, but grey-zone fan work online starts disappearing overnight as platforms rush to avoid lawsuits."
 JAP_national_network: "Integrated National Network Grid"
 JAP_national_network_desc: "The Digital Agency draws up a plan to stitch Japan's separate networks into a single backbone. NTT, KDDI and SoftBank are pushed to link fibre routes and 5G towers into shared core hubs, JR rail signalling and expressway control systems are tied into the same secure backbone, and major power utilities begin feeding grid data through it as well. Ministries in Kasumigaseki gain a live overview of telecoms, transport and energy flows on one screen instead of juggling isolated systems."
 JAP_new_generation: "Rise of a New Generation"
 JAP_new_generation_desc: "A younger generation begins reshaping Japan's social expectations. Workplace hierarchies loosen as twenty- and thirty-somethings push for flexible hours and remote work, rural towns recruit digital migrants with cheap housing, and new political groups form around climate policy, equality and tech reform. The shift is subtle at first, but old norms rooted in lifetime employment and rigid seniority start giving way to a society where mobility and individual choice matter more than deference."
 JAP_counter_tiger_mothers: "Balanced Childhood Campaign"
 JAP_counter_tiger_mothers_desc: "Education officials move to ease the pressure of the kyōiku mama culture. Boards of education issue limits on late-night juku hours, primary schools cut back on test-style drills, and homeroom teachers are told to flag extreme cram schedules to parents. Public TV runs spots about sleep and playtime, and entrance exams at some junior highs start weighing interviews and portfolios more heavily so that endless drilling matters a little less than a child's overall wellbeing."
 JAP_dori_edu: "Dōri Education Principle"
 JAP_dori_edu_desc: "Adopt the dōri principle in classrooms by shifting lessons toward logic, reasoning and independent thought rather than rote memorisation. Textbooks are rewritten with open-ended problems, teachers receive new training modules, and nationwide exams begin including sections that reward argumentation and practical judgement. Students who once focused on reciting answers are now pushed to explain how they reached them."
 JAP_evolving_conservatism: "Evolving Conservatism"
 JAP_evolving_conservatism_desc: "A new conservative current takes shape inside Japan's ruling circles. Rather than defending every postwar habit, younger lawmakers argue for selective tradition—protecting family structures and national identity while accepting female workforce growth, digital governance and more flexible immigration. Old-guard factions resist, but party debates shift as modernisers try to update conservatism for an era of shrinking populations and globalised competition."
 JAP_jiko_sekinin: "Jiko-Sekinin Doctrine"
 JAP_jiko_sekinin_desc: "Promote the jiko-sekinin doctrine, the idea that individuals must bear full responsibility for the consequences of their choices. Welfare offices tighten eligibility checks, disaster relief guidelines stress personal preparedness, and government spokespeople begin framing financial hardship and career setbacks as matters of personal discipline. Public criticism grows as the line between self-reliance and abandonment becomes increasingly thin."
 JAP_new_dotoku: "Renewed Dōtoku Standard"
 JAP_new_dotoku_desc: "Update moral education by redefining the dōtoku standard for a modern society. Classrooms receive new materials on empathy, digital behaviour and civic responsibility, while teachers are trained to guide discussions on fairness, cooperation and respect across cultures. The old emphasis on quiet obedience gives way to a model that expects students to navigate ethical choices in an interconnected world."
 JAP_k_computer: "K Computer Supercomputing Hub"
 JAP_k_computer_desc: "Channel new funding into the K computer facility in Kobe, turning RIKEN and Fujitsu's machine into the core of Japan's high-performance computing network. Climate and typhoon models are rerun at finer detail, earthquake and tsunami simulations are shared with emergency planners, and pharmaceutical labs book whole racks of nodes for drug design. University researchers who once queued for limited time slots now receive expanded access, and ministries start routing long-term infrastructure planning through K computer–backed simulations instead of rough spreadsheets."
 JAP_interdiscipline_science: "Interdisciplinary Science Platforms"
 JAP_interdiscipline_science_desc: "Research funding is reshaped around cross-field projects that link physics labs, medical schools, AI groups and materials centres. RIKEN teams are paired with University of Tokyo and Kyoto University departments, shared campuses are set up between engineering and life-science faculties, and new grants require at least two disciplines to cooperate. Cancer research units start working with data scientists, battery chemists sit next to climate modellers, and doctoral students move more easily between once-separate fields."
 JAP_commercialism_science: "Science-to-Market Push"
 JAP_commercialism_science_desc: "METI and the Cabinet Office order universities and national labs to turn more research into products and patents. RIKEN, AIST and leading campuses like Todai and Keio set up joint venture labs with Toyota, Sony and SoftBank, while tech-transfer offices get targets for spin-offs and licensing income. Professors are encouraged to file patents instead of burying results in journals, and graduate students are steered toward startup incubators in Tokyo and Osaka rather than purely academic careers."
 JAP_selection_and_concentration: "Select and Concentrate Strategy"
 JAP_selection_and_concentration_desc: "Budget planners stop spreading money thinly across every project and begin picking winners. A short list of priority sectors—advanced semiconductors, battery technology, green energy and defence electronics—is drawn up, and minor grant lines for weaker fields are quietly wound down. Universities and companies that make the cut receive multi-year funding guarantees and fast-track regulatory treatment, while those outside the circle are told to merge, pivot or survive on their own."
 JAP_humanities: "Humanities and Social Sciences Revival"
 JAP_humanities_desc: "MEXT reverses years of quiet pressure to shrink humanities faculties at national universities. Literature, philosophy, history, law and sociology departments at places like Todai, Kyoto and Hitotsubashi are promised stable funding instead of merger talks, and new scholarships are earmarked for students outside the hard sciences. Entrance quotas that once favoured engineering and natural science are rebalanced, and interdisciplinary programmes are set up so that future bureaucrats and researchers are expected to study ethics, politics and culture alongside data and lab work."
 JAP_protect_faculty: "Technical University Safeguards"
 JAP_protect_faculty_desc: "MEXT draws a red line around Japan's core technical universities and engineering faculties. Tokyo Institute of Technology, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Tohoku and Osaka's engineering campuses, and the nationwide kōsen colleges are promised stable lab budgets, protected staff posts and priority equipment upgrades. When other departments are asked to merge or tighten belts, these technical programmes are explicitly exempted so that Japan's supply of engineers and researchers is never put at risk."
 JAP_protect_academism: "Academic Freedom Protections"
 JAP_protect_academism_desc: "Strengthen legal and financial safeguards that keep Japan's universities independent from political pressure. Boards of trustees at national campuses gain clearer authority over hiring and curriculum, grant agencies are barred from penalising critical research, and publication reviews are separated from ministry influence. Professors at Todai, Kyoto and regional universities can pursue controversial topics without fearing budget retaliation, and students see a campus climate where debate and inquiry take priority over factional demands."
 JAP_nation_of_science: "Genetic Science Nation"
 JAP_nation_of_science_desc: "Turn Japan into a centre of genetic research by pouring money and regulatory support into cutting-edge labs. RIKEN and Kyoto University's iPS cell teams receive long-term funding guarantees, university hospitals in Tokyo and Osaka open dedicated gene therapy wards, and Takeda and other pharmaceutical firms are pushed into joint projects on rare diseases and cancer. Ethics guidelines are updated so clinical trials can move faster without losing public trust, and high-school curricula quietly add more biology so the next generation can staff the labs now being built."
 JAP_reorganise_universities: "University–Industry Research Clusters"
 JAP_reorganise_universities_desc: "National universities are reorganised into regional research clusters built around local industries. Tohoku University is steered toward materials and disaster-resilience work with Sendai's manufacturers, Tsukuba is paired with JAXA and AI firms, Kyushu focuses on robotics and automotive research with Toyota and Nissan plants, and Hokkaido is pushed deeper into food science and agri-tech. Smaller campuses are merged into these hubs, and promotion committees quietly begin ranking industrial joint projects above purely theoretical output."
 JAP_san_gaku_kan: "San–Gaku–Kan Space Consortium"
 JAP_san_gaku_kan_desc: "Use the san–gaku–kan framework to form a national space technology consortium. JAXA teams are paired with engineers from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and IHI Aerospace to develop new launch systems, while the University of Tokyo, Tohoku University and RIKEN provide guidance on propulsion, materials and orbital science. NEC and Hitachi supply satellite electronics and on-board computers, allowing government, academia and industry to work as a single pipeline from concept to flight. Japan's scattered space expertise begins to converge into one coordinated program."
 JAP_reboot_sigma: "Reboot Project SIGMA"
 JAP_reboot_sigma_desc: "Cabinet planners pull an old cross-ministry strategy file back off the shelf and relaunch it under the name Project SIGMA. METI, MEXT, the Digital Agency and the Defence Ministry are told to align their technology roadmaps around a shared set of targets in AI, quantum computing, space systems and advanced materials. Senior officials summon RIKEN, JAXA and corporate labs from firms like Fujitsu and Toshiba into closed workshops, and ten-year funding guidelines are rewritten so that big national projects all point in the same direction instead of competing for separate pots of money."
 JAP_finance_reformed: "Reformed Ministry of Finance"
 JAP_finance_reformed_desc: "The Ministry of Finance undergoes a top-to-bottom reorganisation. Budget and Tax Bureaus are pulled closer together so spending plans and revenue forecasts are written in the same room, the Financial Services Agency gains clearer authority over megabank supervision, and a new debt-management unit is created to track bond issuance in real time. Senior posts are reshuffled away from pure seniority, and policy teams are told to produce multi-year fiscal plans instead of one-year patches."
 JAP_diplomacy: "Modern Japanese Diplomacy"
 JAP_diplomacy_desc: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is told to step out of its cautious postwar routine and act more visibly abroad. Ambassadors in Washington, Beijing, Seoul and Brussels receive instructions to push Japan's positions on trade, security and technology more assertively, while new posts are opened in Southeast Asia and Africa. Cabinet ministers begin scheduling regular shuttle diplomacy and summit visits, and MOFA speechwriters rewrite talking points so Japan sounds less like a quiet observer and more like a country prepared to shape events."
 JAP_friendship_asean: "ASEAN Partnership Framework"
 JAP_friendship_asean_desc: "Deepen ties with ASEAN by upgrading Japan's role in regional forums and joint projects. MOFA expands embassies in Jakarta, Hanoi and Bangkok, JICA funds new rail, port and energy corridors across Southeast Asia, and defence attachés begin regular staff talks with Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines. Business delegations follow, and Japanese firms receive political backing to anchor supply chains in the region rather than relying solely on China."
 JAP_chiang_mai: "Chiang Mai Initiative Network"
 JAP_chiang_mai_desc: "Use the Chiang Mai Initiative as the backbone of a denser Asian financial safety net. Officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan sit down with counterparts from South Korea, China and ASEAN members to expand swap lines, streamline activation rules and speed up crisis decision-making. Quiet agreements on how to handle sudden capital flight or currency attacks are written into new protocols, and Tokyo positions the yen as a key anchor for emergency liquidity in the region."
 JAP_quantitative_oda: "Expanded ODA Commitments"
 JAP_quantitative_oda_desc: "Raise Japan's official development assistance by setting a higher multi-year target for aid as a share of GNI. JICA is instructed to scale up infrastructure loans and technical cooperation in Southeast Asia and Africa, JBIC is given more room to finance power plants and rail lines, and embassies receive larger grant windows for local schools, clinics and disaster projects. Budget officials grumble about the extra yen leaving Tokyo, but Japanese flags start appearing on more bridges, ports and industrial zones across the developing world."
 JAP_qualitative_oda: "Quality-Focused ODA"
 JAP_qualitative_oda_desc: "Shift Japan's aid policy from pure volume toward project quality and standards. JICA is told to favour climate-friendly power plants over coal, urban rail over highways, and governance and education programs over prestige monuments. New screening rules demand transparent procurement, environmental safeguards and local job guarantees before yen loans are approved. Fewer projects are signed on paper, but partner governments know that those which pass Tokyo's filters will actually work and last."
 JAP_security_south_china_sea: "South China Sea Security Posture"
 JAP_security_south_china_sea_desc: "Step up Japan's quiet role in the South China Sea. Joint exercises with the US and Australia are expanded, and every visit by a Japanese destroyer or coast guard cutter is carefully photographed for regional media. Japan expects sea lanes and airspace in the South China Sea to remain open."
 JAP_away_dependence: "Reduce U.S. Dependence"
 JAP_away_dependence_desc: "Quietly move Japan away from overreliance on the United States in trade, technology and security. Ministries diversify defence procurement toward European and domestic manufacturers, encourage semiconductor and battery firms to build plants outside the U.S. market, and expand diplomatic channels with ASEAN, India and Australia. The alliance remains intact, but Japan begins building room to maneuver without assuming Washington will always align with its priorities."
 JAP_development_production: "Integrated Development and Production"
 JAP_development_production_desc: "Break down the wall between Japan's design offices and factory floors. METI pushes major firms to form joint development–production teams, letting engineers from Toyota, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Hitachi sit alongside line managers and suppliers during early design. Prototypes are tested on real assembly lines instead of on paper, feedback loops are shortened, and new models reach mass production with fewer recalls and last-minute redesigns."
 JAP_japanese_doctrine: "[JAP_army_name] Doctrine"
 JAP_japanese_doctrine_desc: "Order the [JAP_army_name] to rewrite their playbooks around Japan's real threats: island defence, missile strikes and grey-zone incursions. Separate manuals are replaced with a unified doctrine that tells every unit how it is meant to fight if Japan's airspace or sea lanes are challenged."
 JAP_recalling_researchers: "Recall Overseas Researchers"
 JAP_recalling_researchers_desc: "Create incentives for Japanese scientists working in the U.S. and Europe to return home. Universities and national labs offer fast-track posts, upgraded facilities and competitive grants, aiming to reverse decades of talent outflow and rebuild domestic research strength."
 JAP_japanese_cloud: "Kasumigaseki Cloud"
 JAP_japanese_cloud_desc: "Build a government-run “Kasumigaseki Cloud” operated by Japanese providers and hosted on domestic servers. Ministries and key agencies migrate their systems onto this shared platform to cut costs, standardise security and keep sensitive data under national control."
 JAP_base_okinawa: "Okinawa Base Realignment"
 JAP_base_okinawa_desc: "Order a full review of the U.S. and JSDF footprint in Okinawa. Tokyo enters new talks on relocating the most controversial facilities, consolidating scattered sites and shifting some training to Kyushu and Guam, while promising extra economic support to affected towns. The aim is to ease local resentment without weakening deterrence in the Ryukyu island chain."
 JAP_enhancement_exercises: "Enhanced Joint Exercises"
 JAP_enhancement_exercises_desc: "Deepen integration with U.S. forces through larger and more frequent joint drills. Maritime, air and ground units rehearse shared procedures, communications and logistics so that in a real crisis both sides can move, fight and resupply as a single, coordinated force."
 JAP_education_jap_usa: "Japan U.S. Security Education"
 JAP_education_jap_usa_desc: "Expand training programs that rotate Japanese officers through U.S. war colleges and bring American instructors to Ichigaya and Yokosuka. Shared courses on doctrine, planning and cyber defence help both sides understand each other's decision-making and strengthen day-to-day cooperation within the alliance."
 JAP_culture_technology: "Japan U.S. Tech Culture Exchange"
 JAP_culture_technology_desc: "Tighten links between Japanese firms and U.S. tech hubs by pairing university labs and studios with partners in Silicon Valley, Seattle and Los Angeles. Engineers, designers and creators move back and forth on joint projects, blending American platform know-how with Japanese hardware, games and animation."
 JAP_dual_use: "Dual-Use Technology Shift"
 JAP_dual_use_desc: "Reorganise research budgets so civilian projects in robotics, space, AI and materials are designed from the start with military applications in mind. Universities, JAXA labs and major manufacturers are nudged to frame satellite systems, drones and sensors as tools that can serve both commercial clients and the Self-Defense Forces."
 JAP_okinawa_development: "Okinawa Development Plan"
 JAP_okinawa_development_desc: "Launch a long-term development plan for Okinawa built around tourism, renewable energy and technology parks instead of base money alone. New flight routes and resort zones are mapped out on Miyako and Ishigaki, subsidies draw call centres and IT firms to Naha, and funds are set aside to upgrade roads, ports and universities across the islands."
 JAP_informal_cooperation: "Informal Cooperation with Taiwan"
 JAP_informal_cooperation_desc: "Quietly deepen working ties with Taiwan without changing formal recognition. Coast guards share data on Chinese incursions around the Senkaku Islands, JETRO's Taipei office helps link Japanese firms into Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain, and Diet friendship groups begin regular visits masked as ‘private' travel. Crisis hotlines and disaster-relief channels are set up behind the scenes so coordination works even when official statements stay vague."
 JAP_disaster_countermeasure_cooperation: "Japan–Taiwan Disaster Cooperation"
 JAP_disaster_countermeasure_cooperation_desc: "Set up regular disaster-response cooperation with Taiwan built around earthquakes, typhoons and tsunamis. Agencies quietly share early-warning data, stockpile maps and evacuation plans, and organise joint drills for coast guards and rescue teams. When the next major storm or quake hits, ships, helicopters and relief supplies can move across the strait without waiting for formal diplomatic gestures."
 JAP_tai_high_technology: "Japan–Taiwan High-Tech Link"
 JAP_tai_high_technology_desc: "Tighten high-tech ties with Taiwan around semiconductors and advanced electronics. METI and JETRO court TSMC, UMC and major Taiwanese suppliers to build plants in Kyushu and Tohoku, while Japanese firms provide materials, lithography components and power equipment. Joint R&D centres and talent exchanges quietly lock both sides into the same chip ecosystem."
 JAP_tai_tourist_visa: "Taiwan Tourist Visa Scheme"
 JAP_tai_tourist_visa_desc: "Ease travel rules for Taiwanese visitors by expanding visa-free entry, lengthening permitted stays and adding new flights to regional airports. Tourism boards in Hokkaido, Kyushu and Okinawa coordinate campaigns in Taipei and Kaohsiung, aiming to turn Taiwan into one of Japan's most reliable and politically uncomplicated visitor markets."
 JAP_tai_international_student: "Taiwan Student Pathway"
 JAP_tai_international_student_desc: "Create a dedicated pathway for Taiwanese students to study in Japan. Universities expand scholarship slots, ease language requirements and open more dormitory space, while MEXT speeds up student-visa approvals. Graduates receive clearer routes into Japanese companies, helping to anchor long-term people-to-people ties across the strait."
 JAP_history_education: "Regional History Curriculum"
 JAP_history_education_desc: "Revise school history textbooks to deal more directly with Japan's wars and colonial rule in Korea and China. New chapters cover the annexation of Korea, the Nanjing Massacre and forced labour with more detail, and MEXT invites Korean and Chinese scholars onto advisory panels. Teachers receive fresh guidance notes, and exchange trips to Seoul, Busan and Nanjing are encouraged so pupils see how the same events appear in neighbouring classrooms."
 JAP_statement: "Statement of Apology"
 JAP_statement_desc: "Issue a formal government apology for Japan's wartime actions in Korea, China and across Asia. The Prime Minister delivers a clear acknowledgement of suffering caused by military occupation, forced labour and abuses against civilians, and pledges continued cooperation with regional governments on remembrance and reconciliation. Archives are opened further to researchers, and embassies relay the statement to neighbouring capitals as a gesture meant to lower tensions and rebuild trust."
 JAP_intellectual_platform: "East Asia Intellectual Platform"
 JAP_intellectual_platform_desc: "Set up a standing platform where Japanese scholars, journalists and policy experts meet counterparts from China and Korea outside formal diplomacy. Universities host roundtables on security, history and trade, think tanks launch joint reports, and translators prepare bilingual editions of key essays. Arguments are often sharp, but the habit of talking face to face gives governments a pool of people who understand each other when crises flare."
 JAP_chi_friendship: "China Friendship Initiative"
 JAP_chi_friendship_desc: "Stabilise relations with Beijing by reopening high-level visits and practical cooperation. MOFA restarts regular foreign- and defence-minister talks, business federations organise joint forums in Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing, and tourism campaigns push direct flights between regional cities. Maritime hotlines and fisheries agreements in the East China Sea are quietly refreshed so that tensions at sea are less likely to spiral out of control."
 JAP_chi_trade_support: "China Trade Support Framework"
 JAP_chi_trade_support_desc: "Extend support to Japanese firms operating in China through insurance, financing and regulatory guidance. METI and JETRO expand desks in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Dalian to help companies navigate local rules, secure supply chains and manage rising geopolitical risks. Quiet backchannels with Chinese ministries are used to keep factories running and approvals moving even when political tensions spike."
 JAP_chi_advancement_companies: "Advance Companies into China"
 JAP_chi_advancement_companies_desc: "Encourage a new wave of Japanese investment in China by backing mid-sized manufacturers and service firms that have stayed home until now. JETRO organises scouting trips to coastal provinces and inland hubs, megabanks extend credit lines for joint ventures, and prefectural business delegations tour industrial parks in Shanghai, Suzhou and Chengdu to secure factory sites and local partners."
 JAP_chi_kanji: "Shared Kanji Heritage"
 JAP_chi_kanji_desc: "Promote cultural cooperation with China through the shared heritage of kanji. Language institutes in Tokyo, Beijing and Shanghai hold joint workshops on calligraphy and classical texts, universities open exchange courses on character history and usage, and museums curate travelling exhibits that trace how writing spread across East Asia. The programme softens political tensions by reminding both publics of deep linguistic and cultural ties."
 JAP_chi_temple: "Temple Restoration Exchange"
 JAP_chi_temple_desc: "Support cultural ties with China by pairing Japanese temples with historic Buddhist and Daoist sites on the mainland. Restoration teams from Kyoto and Nara collaborate with counterparts in Hangzhou, Xi'an and Chengdu to repair halls, catalog relics and preserve ancient murals. Monks and scholars travel between the sites for study sessions and seasonal ceremonies, rebuilding trust through shared religious heritage rather than politics."
 JAP_kor_friendship: "Rebuild Ties with South Korea"
 JAP_kor_friendship_desc: "Work to rebuild trust with South Korea after years of diplomatic friction. Leaders restart regular summits, foreign ministries reopen suspended dialogue channels, and business groups coordinate on chips, batteries and hydrogen projects. Student exchanges and tourism campaigns are revived so that ordinary Japanese and Koreans see more of each other than headlines about disputes."
 JAP_kor_accelerator: "Japan-Korea Business Accelerator"
 JAP_kor_accelerator_desc: "Set up a joint Japan-Korea business accelerator in Tokyo and Seoul to push startups and mid-sized firms into each other's markets. Shared office space, legal help and matchmaking events pair Japanese robotics, materials and gaming companies with Korean partners in chips, batteries and entertainment. Small teams move back and forth on six-month programmes, testing products, signing distributors and learning how the other side actually does business."
 JAP_kor_local_companies: "Link Local Firms with Korea"
 JAP_kor_local_companies_desc: "Encourage prefectural and city-level firms to build direct ties with South Korean partners. Chambers of commerce in Fukuoka, Osaka and Aichi organise trade fairs in Busan, Incheon and Daegu, while local governments set up small liaison offices to help SMEs find distributors and suppliers. Industrial towns that once only dealt with Tokyo start seeing Korean logos on factory gates and joint projects on shop floors."
 JAP_kor_cultural_exchange: "Japan-Korea Cultural Exchange"
 JAP_kor_cultural_exchange_desc: "Expand cultural exchange with South Korea through festivals, school links and media tie-ups. City governments twin Osaka with Busan and Yokohama with Incheon, NHK co-produces dramas and documentaries with KBS, and student groups trade homestays and language classes. J-pop and K-pop acts share stages at joint events, giving younger Japanese and Koreans more chances to meet each other than old arguments in the news."
 JAP_kor_aging: "Japan-Korea Aging Society Forum"
 JAP_kor_aging_desc: "Create a standing forum where Japan and South Korea compare how they handle shrinking, aging populations. Welfare officials swap notes on pension reform and long-term care insurance, city planners trade ideas on nursing homes and senior housing, and robotics firms demo care robots and monitoring systems on both sides. Policy papers and pilot projects move back and forth, as two of the world's oldest societies quietly learn from each other's mistakes."
 JAP_approaching_russia: "Approach Russia"
 JAP_approaching_russia_desc: "Test a cautious opening toward Moscow built around energy and investment. MOFA revives economic talks on Sakhalin gas and Arctic shipping, Japanese firms send delegations to Vladivostok and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and local governments in Hokkaido explore cross-border projects. Territorial disputes stay on ice, but both sides probe whether limited cooperation is still possible."
 JAP_sov_far_east_development: "Develop the Russian Far East"
 JAP_sov_far_east_development_desc: "Offer Japanese capital and know-how to develop the Russian Far East. Trading houses and construction firms look at ports in Vladivostok and Nakhodka, LNG and timber projects on Sakhalin, and farming ventures along the Amur. Tokyo frames the deals as practical cooperation close to Hokkaido, leaving wider politics and territorial disputes outside the official brief."
 JAP_sov_saakhalin: "Sakhalin Energy Cooperation"
 JAP_sov_saakhalin_desc: "Pursue limited cooperation with Russia on Sakhalin by securing long-term access to LNG and maintaining Japanese stakes in the Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 projects. Tokyo keeps the agenda tightly focused on energy security while avoiding broader political commitments."
 JAP_sov_logistics_corridor: "Russia-Japan Logistics Corridor"
 JAP_sov_logistics_corridor_desc: "Explore a logistics corridor linking Japan to Europe through Russia. Shipping routes from Toyama and Niigata are tied into rail hubs at Vladivostok and the Trans-Siberian line, giving Japanese exporters an overland alternative to congested sea lanes."
 JAP_sov_it_corridor: "Russia-Japan Digital Corridor"
 JAP_sov_it_corridor_desc: "Test a digital corridor with Russia by linking Japanese data centres to fibre routes through Vladivostok and Siberia. Telecom operators trial low-latency connections for finance and cloud services, offering an overland backup if Pacific cables are disrupted."
 JAP_asian_community: "East Asian Community Vision"
 JAP_asian_community_desc: "Revive talk of an East Asian Community built around closer ties between Japan, China, South Korea and ASEAN. Leaders float ideas like looser visa rules and more regular trilateral summits, while officials quietly draft proposals for shared infrastructure funds and regional energy grids that could one day tie the bloc together."
 JAP_eaec: "Revive the East Asia Economic Caucus"
 JAP_eaec_desc: "Pick up old proposals for an East Asia Economic Caucus and give them new life. Tokyo sounds out ASEAN, South Korea and China about coordinating trade positions in WTO talks, standardising rules on investment and quietly using regional meetings to agree common lines before facing the U.S. and Europe."
 JAP_epa: "Economic Partnership Agreement"
 JAP_epa_desc: "Advance negotiations on a broad Economic Partnership Agreement with key Asian partners. Trade officials map out tariff cuts on machinery and autos, simplify rules of origin and press for smoother customs procedures so Japanese exporters and investors face fewer hurdles across the region."
 JAP_eaec_split_candidates: "EAEC Leadership Split"
 JAP_eaec_split_candidates_desc: "As plans for an East Asia Economic Caucus move forward, member states start backing different leaders. Some governments quietly line up behind Tokyo's proposals, while others lean toward Beijing's vision. Diplomats in the region begin counting votes and building blocs before the new forum has even met once."
 JAP_eaec_plus: "EAEC+ Expansion Talks"
 JAP_eaec_plus_desc: "Discuss widening the East Asia Economic Caucus to include partners beyond the original core. ASEAN states suggest India or Australia, while Japan floats adding economies like New Zealand or even the UK to deepen supply-chain resilience. The debate signals an EAEC that could grow into a broader regional bloc rather than a tight, exclusive circle."
 JAP_eaec_pacific: "EAEC Pacific Outreach"
 JAP_eaec_pacific_desc: "Test the idea of stretching the East Asia Economic Caucus across the Pacific. Tokyo quietly sounds out Australia and New Zealand about closer coordination on trade rules and supply chains, hinting that EAEC decisions could one day shape standards far beyond East Asia itself."
 JAP_community_relations: "Improve Intra-Community Relations"
 JAP_community_relations_desc: "Encourage smoother cooperation among EAEC members by expanding working groups on trade, energy and transport. Officials iron out minor disputes, harmonise standards where possible and promote regular minister-level meetings so the bloc operates with fewer frictions and surprises."
 JAP_community_unity: "Support Divided Nations"
 JAP_community_unity_desc: "Use the East Asian framework to quietly back dialogue in divided nations. Japanese diplomats support inter-Korean projects and cross-strait economic contacts, arguing inside the bloc that long-term stability depends on giving separated societies ways to talk, trade and travel even while political disputes remain unresolved."
 JAP_community_confederations: "Support Future Confederations"
 JAP_community_confederations_desc: "Float the idea inside East Asian forums that some divided nations might one day adopt loose confederation models instead of immediate reunification. Japanese envoys quietly back studies on shared currencies, customs zones and joint administrative bodies, arguing that gradual institutional links could ease tensions and make any future political settlement less risky for the region."
 JAP_community_development: "East Asia Development Fund"
 JAP_community_development_desc: "Propose an East Asia Development Fund to finance ports, power grids and rail links across member states. Tokyo offers seed money and JICA expertise, expecting joint projects in poorer regions to bind the bloc together and give Japanese firms a natural role in building the new infrastructure."
 JAP_community_corruption: "Community Anti-Corruption Watch"
 JAP_community_corruption_desc: "Push for an anti-corruption watchdog inside the East Asian framework. Member states agree to share blacklists of banned contractors, publish more details on funded projects and allow mixed audit teams to inspect suspicious tenders. Firms that get caught rigging bids in one country find doors closing across the whole bloc."
 JAP_community_energy: "East Asia Energy Network"
 JAP_community_energy_desc: "Promote shared energy solutions inside the East Asian framework. Officials study cross-border power cables and gas pipelines, compare LNG and renewables plans, and begin sketching a regional grid where surplus from one member can help cover shortages in another."
 JAP_epa_economics: "Integrated Regional Economies"
 JAP_epa_economics_desc: "Use new Economic Partnership Agreements to weave East Asian economies more tightly together. Tariffs come down on key goods, customs procedures are aligned and investment rules are simplified so factories, parts and capital can move more easily across borders."
 JAP_epa_autonomy: "Sovereign Economic Autonomy"
 JAP_epa_autonomy_desc: "Write Economic Partnership Agreements so deeper integration does not erase local control. Clauses on tax, labour and environmental rules are drafted to respect each country's sovereign choices, and room is left for special autonomous regions or zones to tailor implementation without blocking the overall deal."
 JAP_asian_union: "Towards an Asian Union"
 JAP_asian_union_desc: "Float a long-term vision of an Asian Union that goes beyond trade deals and loose forums. Policy papers in Tokyo sketch ideas for shared institutions, freer movement of people and tighter coordination on currency and defence, hinting that today's agreements could one day grow into a political community spanning the region."
 JAP_global_community: "Global Community Vision"
 JAP_global_community_desc: "Recast Japan's role as a builder of global rules rather than a quiet follower. Diplomats push harder inside the UN, G7 and G20 on climate, digital governance and development, and Tokyo offers to host regular ministerial meetings that bring Asian, European and American officials into the same room to talk through shared crises instead of trading statements from afar."
 JAP_dca: "Development Cooperation Charter"
 JAP_dca_desc: "Update Japan's Development Cooperation Charter so aid, trade and security policy point in the same direction. MOFA and JICA rewrite guidelines to prioritise “quality growth,” rule of law and maritime security, tying yen loans and technical projects more tightly to partners that share Japan's interests and values."
 JAP_dca_intern: "Expand the Intern Training Program"
 JAP_dca_intern_desc: "Broaden the Technical Intern Training Program under the Development Cooperation Charter. More slots are opened for trainees from Southeast Asia, and partner governments receive funds to improve language screening and pre-departure training. Companies in Japan gain clearer oversight rules, aiming to turn the scheme from cheap labour into a more credible skills-transfer pathway."
 JAP_dca_foreign_labor: "Foreign Worker Exchange Agreements"
 JAP_dca_foreign_labor_desc: "Use the Development Cooperation Charter to sign worker exchange agreements with selected partner countries. Ministries match ageing Japanese industries with surplus labour abroad, set caps and skill lists, and require employers to provide language support and monitored housing. In return, sending states receive training guarantees and remittance schemes that feed money back into their own development plans."
 JAP_dca_investments: "Adventurous Development Investments"
 JAP_dca_investments_desc: "Allow Japan's development banks to take bolder stakes in high-risk, high-impact projects abroad under the Development Cooperation Charter. JBIC and JICA are encouraged to back ports, power grids and digital networks in frontier markets where private finance hesitates, trading safer returns for greater political influence and long-term economic ties."
 JAP_dca_bankers: "Global Development Bankers"
 JAP_dca_bankers_desc: "Push Japanese banks deeper into development finance under the Development Cooperation Charter. JBIC and megabanks like MUFG and Mizuho are encouraged to co-finance infrastructure and climate projects with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, turning Tokyo's lenders into visible players in global development deals instead of quiet backers in the background."
 JAP_dca_malacca: "Malacca Strait Shipping Talks"
 JAP_dca_malacca_desc: "Open talks with Singapore and Malaysia on how Japan's larger LNG carriers and container ships will move through the Malacca Strait in coming decades. Port upgrades at Singapore and Port Klang, new traffic separation schemes and joint funding for navigation aids are put on the table under the Development Cooperation Charter so vital shipping lanes stay open as vessels grow in size."
 JAP_dca_islands: "Develop Key Economic Islands"
 JAP_dca_islands_desc: "Channel Development Cooperation Charter funds into upgrading economically important islands such as Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. Projects focus on ports, tourism infrastructure and renewable energy so these remote territories can support trade, research and regional connectivity."
 JAP_dca_expand: "Expand the Development Cooperation Charter"
 JAP_dca_expand_desc: "Broaden the Development Cooperation Charter so it covers more partners and sectors. New guidelines add digital infrastructure, climate adaptation and maritime security to the list of priority fields, and embassies receive wider authority to propose projects that match Japan's strategic interests as well as local needs."
 JAP_basic_reconstruction_policy: "Basic Reconstruction Policy"
 JAP_basic_reconstruction_policy_desc: "Agree on a national Basic Reconstruction Policy for the disaster-hit Tōhoku coast. The cabinet sets priorities for rebuilding homes and ports in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima, restores rail and highway links, and outlines how new sea walls, evacuation routes and town plans will be funded over the next decade."
 JAP_tohoku_infrastructure: "Rebuild Tōhoku Infrastructure"
 JAP_tohoku_infrastructure_desc: "Prioritise hard infrastructure along the disaster-hit Tōhoku coast. Damaged stretches of the Jōban Line and Tōhoku Expressway are rebuilt and raised, and key ports such as Sendai-Shiogama receive upgraded quays, breakwaters and access roads to anchor long-term recovery."
 JAP_fishery_revival: "Revive Tōhoku Fisheries"
 JAP_fishery_revival_desc: "Rebuild harbours and auction facilities in towns like Kesennuma and Ishinomaki, replace lost fishing fleets, and restore cold-chain links so coastal communities can restart their core industry."
 JAP_tohoku_port: "Restore Tōhoku Ports"
 JAP_tohoku_port_desc: "Reconstruct damaged piers and breakwaters at key ports such as Onahama and Hachinohe, ensuring cargo traffic and relief logistics can move again at full capacity."
 JAP_power_supply: "Stabilise Regional Power Supply"
 JAP_power_supply_desc: "Repair substations, reinforce transmission lines and add temporary generation across Tōhoku and northern Kantō so blackouts no longer threaten recovery work."
 JAP_kanto_infrastructure: "Support Kantō Infrastructure"
 JAP_kanto_infrastructure_desc: "Strengthen critical links in the wider Kantō region—expressways, river embankments and rail hubs—to prevent cascading disruptions reaching Tokyo's metropolitan area."
 JAP_reconstruction_agency: "Establish Reconstruction Agency"
 JAP_reconstruction_agency_desc: "Create a dedicated Reconstruction Agency with authority over budgets, permits and coordination across ministries, enabling faster decisions for rebuilding Tōhoku."
 JAP_industrial_recovery: "Restart Regional Industry"
 JAP_industrial_recovery_desc: "Help factories in Sendai, Koriyama and coastal industrial zones replace damaged equipment, restore supply chains and restart production in key sectors."
 JAP_funding_local_governments: "Fund Local Governments"
 JAP_funding_local_governments_desc: "Provide multi-year grants and special bonds to municipalities in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima so they can rebuild schools, clinics and public works without collapsing their budgets."
 JAP_housing_reconstruction: "Reconstruct Housing"
 JAP_housing_reconstruction_desc: "Accelerate the construction of temporary homes and long-term residential districts, moving displaced families out of shelters and giving towns clear plans for permanent resettlement."
 JAP_reconstruction_completed_focus: "Reconstruction Completed"
 JAP_reconstruction_completed_focus_desc: "Mark the transition from emergency rebuilding to long-term revitalisation across Tōhoku. Core infrastructure is restored, industries are running again, and towns begin shifting from survival to growth."

 japan_classic.1.d1: "The Japanese delegation has approached our diplomats and envoys over a possible entry of our armed forces and our country in to their alliance."
 japan_classic.1.d2: "Japan has suggested to their alliance leader, [From.GetName], that we would make a formidable faction member of their military alliance. The [From.GetAdjective] leader [From.GetLeader] apparently agrees and has approached us about a possible alliance entry of our nation."
 japan_classic.1.o1: "We shall join them!"
 japan_classic.1.o2: "We will turn them down."
 japan_classic.2.t: "The push for Korean Unification"
 japan_classic.2.d: "The Korean people are our friend and our destined ally - but part of them is enslaved by totalitarianism. We will work together with Seoul to beat Pyongyang into submission."
 japan_classic.2.o1: "Let's do it."
 japan_classic.3.t: "Japan offers to strike North Korea together"
 japan_classic.3.d: "Our conflict with the North Koreans has been going on for too long; a stalemate nobody is willing to break. But, with a new ally, we could overpower the North Koreans and finally reunite our people.\nThis ally has now revealed themselves to be Japan, which offers to aid us reuniting our country. Their only demand is simple: No concessions to totalitarianism. Total war until freedom is won."
 japan_classic.3.o1: "We will reunite our country!"
 japan_classic.3.o2: "We cannot do this."
 japan_classic.4.t: "Japan and South Korea march on Pyongyang"
 japan_classic.4.d: "The Japanese and South Korean governments have made a joint statement that they would reunite Korea by force. China needs to act now or risks losing their vital buffer state against its East Asian rival. Should we aid Pyongyang? Or leave them to suffer?"
 japan_classic.4.o1: "We will stand and fight!"
 japan_classic.4.o2: "North Korea is insignificant."
 japan_classic.5.t: "China intervenes!"
 japan_classic.5.d: "China has declared its intentions to protect North Korea from our aggression. What do we do now?"

 japan_classic.5.o2: "Well, we lost."
 japan_classic.6.t: "The Second Korean War"
 japan_classic.6.d: "The Japanese-South Korean attack on our borders and our ideologies is the beginning of a Second Korean War. However, with China by our side, we can now safely count on our forces to protect us. What do we do?"
 japan_classic.6.o1: "We fight!"
 japan_classic.6.o2: "China is nice this time of year... let's flee the country."
 japan_classic.7.t: "The Second Korean War"
 japan_classic.7.d: "The Japanese-South Korean attack on our borders and our ideologies is the beginning of a Second Korean War.\nChina has abandoned us, there is little realistic hope. What could we do?"

 japan_classic.9.t: "North Korea flees"
 japan_classic.9.d: "We won! The North Korean tyrants are leaving the country! That means victory!"
 japan_classic.9.o1: "Victory indeed!"
 japan_classic.10.t: "The Chinese Ultimatum"
 japan_classic.10.d: "With Pyongyang out of the way, Beijing has to be our next goal to bring democracy to. China is a completely different enemy from North Korea and the chance that they fold is almost non-existent. We need to be aware that this will cause the war everyone is Asia is afraid of."
 japan_classic.10.o1: "Victory is our destiny!"
 japan_classic.11.t: "Japan offers to send an Ultimatum to China"
 japan_classic.11.d: "The Japanese government has approached us with a simple deal akin to what they already did with Korea: Stop the division of the country by invading the non-democratic part and uniting it under the democratic one.\nHow should we react?"
 japan_classic.11.o1: "We agree!"
 japan_classic.11.o2: "War is not our goal!"
 japan_classic.12.t: "Japan and Taiwan demand unification!"
 japan_classic.12.d: "The governments of Japan and Taiwan have demanded that China be reunited under the democratic leadership of Taiwan and that the [CHI.GetRulingParty] is dissolved in China.\nOur generals laugh at their pretensions. We are gearing for war already."
 japan_classic.12.o1: "Let them come."
 japan_classic.12.o2: "Oh no, we surrender!"
 japan_classic.13.t: "China fights!"
 japan_classic.13.d: "As expected, the PRC is unwilling to give ground and will meet our advances with military action. War it is."

 japan_classic.14.t: "China folds!"
 japan_classic.14.d: "Against all expectations, China has given in to our demands and we can now take control of the former PRC's territory."

 japan_classic.15.t: "Keizō Obuchi suffers stroke"
 japan_classic.15.d: "Keizō Obuchi, a loyal servant of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japanese people, had been Prime Minister of Japan since July 30th, 1998 after the resignation of Ryūtarō Hashimoto after the LDP lost the Upper House election of 1998.\nKeizō Obuchi has been described as calm, qualified and efficient - but few people saw his sudden health drop coming. On April 1st, 2000, Obuchi suffered a stroke and was rushed to a hospital."
 japan_classic.15.o1: "Let's hope for the best."
 japan_classic.16.t: "Replacing Obuchi"
 japan_classic.16.d: "Shortly after Keizō Obuchi's severe stroke, it was clear that he would not quickly be available for service again. The Japanese diet met on April 5th, 2000, to find a replacement for the Prime Minister.\nKeizō Obuchi would never recover again, eventually dying in the hospital on May 14th. He leaves behind one son and two daughters, one of them, Yūko, also a politician of the Liberal Democrats."

 japan_classic.17.o1: "We will send all help needed."
 japan_classic.17.o2: "The situation will rectify itself."
 japan_classic.18.t: "Yoshirō Mori's political gaffe"
 japan_classic.18.d: "On May 15th, 2000, newly elected Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori got into major negative headlines for the first time when he publicly referred to Japan as \"a Divine Nation centered on the Emperor\". This, in the eyes of both the opposition and the ruling LDP, calls the democratic ideals of Japan as well as the role of the monarchy into question.\nPublic approval ratings of the Prime Minister have dropped."
 japan_classic.18.o1: "What a fool!"
 japan_classic.18.o2: "Double down on his statements."
 japan_classic.19.t: "Fusako Shigenobu arrested"
 japan_classic.19.d: "The leader of the Japanese Red Army, Fusako Shigenobu, was arrested in Osaka on November 8th, 2000.\nThe Japanese Red Army was a militant communist militia aiming to destroy the monarchy, topple the Japanese government and start a world revolution.\nFollowing the arrests, the Japanese Red Army would soon be disbanded in early 2001."
 japan_classic.19.o1: "The communist rebels are losing ground."
 japan_classic.19.o2: "Set her free, she is right."
 japan_classic.20.t: "The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster"
 japan_classic.20.d: "On March 11th, 2011, Japan was hit by the devastating Tōhoku earthquake, followed by a tsunami, primarily hitting the north-eastern coast of the island of Honshū.\n\nMany Japanese citizens were displaced and had to leave their homes, but this is not out of the ordinary for a country living on the Pacific Fire Ring. However, the damage done to Fukushima Daiichi, one of Japan's most vital nuclear reactors, is not only out of the ordinary, but absolutely catastrophic.\nIn a nuclear disaster that only Chernobyl 1986 could measure up to, the tsunami destroyed the emergency reactors that were to cool the reactors after the automatic shutdown. The Units 1, 2 and 3 suffered nuclear meltdowns, being accompanied by hydrogen-air chemical explosions and massive release of radioactive material.\n\nThe radiation emitted by the reactor was strong enough to sentence an unprotected human to death after a mere minute; the regional area thus became uninhabitable.\n\nThe catastrophe changed public opinion on nuclear power the world over."
 japan_classic.20.o1: "A black day for our nation."

 japan_classic.70.t: "Japan seeks Chinese Alliance"
 japan_classic.70.d: "The Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] has recently announced that Japan would seek a new possible alliance with its former rival and constant adversary China.\nThe Chinese have yet to respond - but whatever Beijing's decision might be, the political climate of East Asia is changing."
 japan_classic.70.o1: "A new age!"
 japan_classic.70.o2: "Let us hope for the best."
 japan_classic.70.o3: "We shall consider our choices."

 japan_classic.70.o5: "How odd."
 japan_classic.70.o6: "We will destroy them anyway."
 japan_classic.71.t: "Japan embraces the Path of War!"
 japan_classic.71.d: "\"The grand Japanese heritage cannot be put into question by our past experiences and our most shameful defeat in 1945. We need to put our country and our national pride back on its feet and look forward, united, strengthened and ready to strike. We will not avoid conflict just to preserve peace. Not anymore!\"\n\nThe Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] held quite the sensational speech in Tokyo. Japan seems to have renewed ambitions for superpower status."
 japan_classic.71.o1: "We are unstoppable!"
 japan_classic.71.o2: "Hail Japan!"
 japan_classic.71.o3: "Very worrying."
 japan_classic.71.o4: "They need to be stopped."
 japan_classic.71.o5: "Do they want to get nuked AGAIN?"
 japan_classic.72.t: "Japan seeks Trade with China"
 japan_classic.72.d: "Denying American advances into the Japanese economy, the Tokyo government has announced that they would instead seek closer trade relationships with the Chinese, rather than 'selling the Japanese people to the Americans', according to the Japanese Minister of Finance."
 japan_classic.72.o1: "Good choice"
 japan_classic.72.o2: "Intriguing."
 japan_classic.72.o3: "That comes close to betrayal."
 japan_classic.72.o4: "Interesting Development"
 japan_classic.73.t: "Japan adapts Article 9"
 japan_classic.73.d: "Article 9 of the Japanese constitution states: \"Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.\"\nThis has been interpreted to not only outlaw war, but also military action abroad. The Japanese government is now getting rid of the latter clause - putting fear in the opposition that the former might be next."
 japan_classic.73.o1: "It had to be done."
 japan_classic.73.o2: "Japan is remilitarizing."
 japan_classic.74.t: "Japan abandons Defensive Principles"
 japan_classic.74.d: "With the world growing more and more tense, the Japanese government has today declared that it would be ready to defend Japanese interests and its ideological persistence both at home and, importantly, abroad.\n\nThis is a major uproar in Japanese foreign policy."
 japan_classic.74.o1: "Glory to Japan!"
 japan_classic.74.o2: "We stand by our ally."
 japan_classic.74.o3: "How worrying."
 japan_classic.74.o4: "Death to Japan!"
 japan_classic.75.t: "Japan declares Interventionism"
 japan_classic.75.d: "Japan has reassured the global community that it would stand strong in its democratic values, but that it would also pursue a more aggressive foreign policy to enforce democratic principles both at home and abroad."
 japan_classic.75.o1: "Freedom we bring and fascists we slay."
 japan_classic.75.o2: "Good choice"
 japan_classic.75.o3: "Defending democracy is a good thing at least."
 japan_classic.75.o4: "Another one of those 'democrats'. Ugh."
 japan_classic.75.o5: "We will destroy these Japs!"
 japan_classic.76.t: "Japan abolishes the Monarchy"
 japan_classic.76.d: "In a move that draws closer and closer to communistic ideology, the Japanese government has today dismantled the Chrysanthemum Throne, the position of the Japanese Emperor. The first emperor, as according to legend, sat on the throne around 650 BC; and the first confirmed emperor did so in 100 BC. Either way, the Japanese monarchy was the longest-existing monarchy in the world."
 japan_classic.76.o1: "Good riddance."
 japan_classic.76.o2: "Everything has to come to an end."
 japan_classic.77.t: "Japan empowers the Emperor"
 japan_classic.77.d: "\"Japan, in these troubled times, requires a strong and unifying leader, something that I cannot offer.\"\nThe Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] has today angered the opposition of his country and many countries across the world by giving a speech about a possible restoration of Absolute Monarchy in Japan. [JAP.GetLeader] has presented several reforms (that are expected to pass) to the National Diet in order to make the transition happen."
 japan_classic.77.o1: "Long live the Empire!"
 japan_classic.77.o2: "The Japanese are doing the right thing."
 japan_classic.77.o3: "So much for values."
 japan_classic.78.t: "Japan seeks to spread the Revolution"
 japan_classic.78.d: "\"The people of Korea are in desperate need of liberation and their workers shall be freed.\", the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Japan has declared in Tokyo.\nThis is a complete novelty in foreign policy and could mean a war in East Asia."
 japan_classic.78.o1: "Glory to Japan!"
 japan_classic.78.o2: "This is outrageous!"
 japan_classic.78.o3: "The Red Revolution is spreading!"
 japan_classic.78.o4: "We need to fight communism!"
 japan_classic.78.o5: "Totalitarianism is spreading."
 japan_classic.79.t: "Japan declares Racial Supremacy"
 japan_classic.79.d: "\"And thus, with scientific and cultural evidence, we have definitive proof that the Japanese people are the chosen race.\"\nEven if the Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] did not present the evidence he spoke of, the implications of a Japanese return to fascism through a declaration of 'racial supremacy' are very severe. Japanese foreign aggression has become very real."
 japan_classic.79.o1: "Hail us!"
 japan_classic.79.o2: "They are going crazy."
 japan_classic.80.t: "[Root.GetName] declares Mass Mobilization"
 japan_classic.80.d: "\"In the name of the safety of our people, our nation and our friends, we need every available recruit. The cynical opposition and our enemies will call this 'mass mobilization', we should rather refer to it as 'national awakening' however. This has nothing to do with foreign aggression.\"\nIn an act of foreign aggression, [Root.GetLeader], head of the [Root.GetAdjective] government, has declared a state of mass mobilization in the country."
 japan_classic.80.o1: "For the fatherland!"
 japan_classic.80.o2: "We still have their backs."
 japan_classic.80.o3: "Let's hope they don't become a threat."
 japan_classic.80.o4: "The [Root.GetAdjective] threat is growing."
 japan_classic.80.o5: "We will enjoy killing these recruits."
 japan_classic.81.t: "The Korean Unification Ultimatum"
 japan_classic.81.d: "In an originally Japanese proposal, the Tokyo and Seoul governments have issued a joint statement called \"Joint Japanese-Korean Demand for Democracy for the Korean People\", in which the two countries threaten North Korea with war in order to unify the Korean Peninsula under Seoul leadership.\nA response is expected not only from Pyongyang, but also from Beijing."

 japan_classic.82.t: "China beats Japan into submission!"
 japan_classic.82.d: "Japan has dropped its demands to the North Korean after the Chinese government called out partial mobilization of its forces and began moving towards the North Korean border, ready to cross it like they did in the 1950s to once again save Pyongyang from utter destruction.\nJapanese diplomatic reputation is tarnished and South Korea has made a fool of itself."
 japan_classic.82.o1: "Shameful display!"

 japan_classic.83.t: "China refuses to aid North Korea!"
 japan_classic.83.d: "\"The Chinese government has no further interest in propping up the failed North Korean state. Our protection for them is null and void.\"\nIn an unprecedented and unexpected move, the Chinese government has abandoned North Korea to its fate in the face of approaching Japanese and South Korean troops."

 japan_classic.84.d: "In the middle of the night, North Korean government officials have fled the country in the face of growing civil resentment and the impending Japanese and South Korean invasion. Several trains left the country for Russia and China, with a government-in-exile possibly in the process of being formed."
 japan_classic.84.o1: "That means victory!"

 japan_classic.85.d: "\"This is the greatest victory of our time. The once oppressed people of the south are now free to live and enjoy life together with their northern brethren, as the almighty eternal ruler intended.\"\nNorth Korean Leader [NKO.GetLeader] held a speech in Seoul, the former capital of South Korea, today. South Korea has failed in the eternal struggle of these two different versions of a Korean nation state. The entire country is now ruled from Pyongyang."
 japan_classic.85.o1: "Glorious!"
 japan_classic.85.o2: "The dawn of a new era."
 japan_classic.86.t: "The South unites Korea!"
 japan_classic.86.d: "\"And thus, we bring the people of North Korea our freedoms and our rights and our virtues, as they are finally free from their oppressors and their slave holders, finally free from slavery and totalitarian rule.\"\nSouth Korean President [KOR.GetLeader] held a speech in Pyongyang, the former capital city of North Korea, today. In the seemingly eternal struggle of the two Koreas against each other, North Korea finally collapsed and gave way to a stronger South Korea, now simply called Korea. The Seoul government has united the Korean people under an independent, united and sovereign government for the first time since the Japanese invaded the Empire of Korea in 1910."

 japan_classic.87.o2: "Alright."
 japan_classic.88.t: "Taiwan reconquers China!"
 japan_classic.88.d: "Taiwan has restored its dominance over the territories of the former People's Republic of China. This means that the Republic of China is truly China once more."
 japan_classic.88.o1: "Glorious!"
 japan_classic.88.o2: "Incredible!"
 japan_classic.89.t: "The Fukushima disaster"
 japan_classic.89.d: "North-eastern Honshū was hit by the Tōhoku earthquake on March 11th, 2011.\nThis earthquake and the subsequent tsunami severely damaged the nuclear power reactor Fukushima Daiichi, which suffered a faulty emergency shutdown and then went on to losing three of its four main units to nuclear meltdowns. This is possibly the greatest nuclear disaster in history, only matched by the 1986 Chernobyl incident."
 japan_classic.89.o1: "Disastrous!"
 japan_classic.89.o2: "Excellent."

 Japan.1.t: "Naka-Meguro Derailment"
 Japan.1.d: "On March 8th, 2000, around 9 AM Japanese time, a TRTA Hibiya Line train was sideswiped by another train, killing 5 and injuring 63 after the rearmost car of the train had derailed in a tight curve, crashing into a bypassing vehicle."
 Japan.1.a: "We will send all help needed."
 Japan.1.b: "The situation will rectify itself."
 Japan.2.t: "Fusako Shigenobu arrested"
 Japan.2.d: "The leader of the Japanese Red Army, Fusako Shigenobu, was arrested in Osaka on November 8th, 2000.\nThe Japanese Red Army was a militant communist militia aiming to destroy the monarchy, to topple the Japanese government and to start a world revolution.\nFollowing the arrests, the Japanese Red Army would soon be disbanded in early 2001."
 Japan.2.a: "The communist rebels are losing ground."

 Japan.3.a: "Atarashī Tennŝ Heika!"
 Japan.8.t: "China is Demanding the Senkaku Islands!"
 Japan.8.d: "China has revived their dispute with us over ownership of the Senkaku islands. If we give in to their demands we might increase China's confidence in its ability to influence our foreign policy as well as reduce our popularity among the more nationalistic of our people. However, the consequences of refusing probably do not bode well for us either."
 Japan.8.a: "Let them have their fishing rights..."
 Japan.8.b: "Japan will not be intimidated!"
 Japan.4.t: "Japan has Handed Over the Islands!"

 Japan.5.d: "The Japanese are clearly as determined to remain our mortal enemies as ever."
 Japan.5.a: "They will regret this..."
 Japan.6.t: "Chinese jets have fired on the aircraft we scrambled to intercept them!"
 Japan.6.d: "Our fighters regularly respond to Chinese incursions into our air space, normally without incident. However this time our fighters were fired upon by the Chinese, resulting in the deaths of several of our pilots and the loss of multiple aircraft. We should evaluate whether this incident, given China's recent actions, was a deliberate provocation or an unfortunate accident and decide our response accordingly."
 Japan.6.a: "We have a right to self-defense!"
 Japan.6.b: "We should call upon our protectors!"
 Japan.6.c: "This was probably an accident..."
 Japan.7.t: "Chinese and Japanese Fighter Jets Engage in Aerial Combat"
 Japan.7.d: "The East China Sea has erupted into conflict following a confrontation between Chinese and Japanese aircraft. The clash reportedly began when Japanese jets were scrambled to intercept Chinese fighters over Japanese airspace. Rather than resulting in a Chinese retreat which has historically occurred after similar incidents, Japanese aircraft were fired upon, resulting in the deaths of several Japanese pilots and the loss of multiple aircraft. [JAP.GetLeader] has strongly condemned the incident and is reportedly engaged in urgent talks behind closed doors regarding Japan's response to this event."
 Japan.7.a: "Is a third Sino-Japanese War on the horizon?"
 JAP_diplomacy.11.t: "U.S. Request to Reinterpret Article 9"
 JAP_diplomacy.11.d: "The government of the United States has approached us with a formal request to further reinterpret Article 9 of our Constitution. Washington argues that the regional security environment has deteriorated to such an extent that Japan must assume a greater share of the collective defense burden. Accepting their request would open the door to a broader understanding of self-defense,and to closer military cooperation, but it will not be without domestic controversy."
 JAP_diplomacy.11.a: "Accept the U.S. request"
 JAP_diplomacy.11.b: "We cannot accept this request"
 JAP_diplomacy.12.t: "Japan Refuses to Reinterpret Article 9"
 JAP_diplomacy.12.d: "Tokyo has informed us that it is not prepared to further reinterpret Article 9 at this time. Concerns over domestic public opinion, constitutional constraints, and political stability have led the Japanese government to reject our request. We must now decide whether to respect their decision or increase diplomatic and security pressure."
 JAP_diplomacy.12.a: "We will respect their decision"
 JAP_diplomacy.12.b: "Increase pressure on Japan"
 JAP_diplomacy.14.t: "U.S. Pressure on Article 9"
 JAP_diplomacy.14.d: "Following our refusal to broaden the interpretation of Article 9, the United States has quietly begun to increase diplomatic and security pressure on our government. Alliance consultations, media briefings, and behind-the-scenes messages all point in the same direction: Washington expects Japan to shoulder more responsibility. We can stand firm or quietly shift our stance."
 JAP_diplomacy.14.a: "We will stand firm"
 JAP_diplomacy.14.b: "Quietly adjust our position"
 JAP_diplomacy.15.t: "Japan Accepts Under Pressure"
 JAP_diplomacy.15.d: "After a period of heightened diplomatic and strategic pressure, Tokyo has indicated that it is prepared to move closer to our position on Article 9. While publicly insisting that Japan's pacifist principles remain unchanged, the government has now broadened its self-defense interpretation in a manner that aligns with our expectations."
 JAP_diplomacy.15.a: "Excellent"
 JAP_diplomacy.17.t: "U.S. Tariffs on Japanese Goods"
 JAP_diplomacy.17.d: "The United States has announced a new package of tariffs targeting key Japanese exports, citing economic imbalances and domestic political pressure. The measures are presented as a way to 'level the playing field,' but in Tokyo they are widely seen as a politically motivated move that will strain both our economy and the broader alliance."
 JAP_diplomacy.17.a: "We will have to adapt to this new reality"
 JAP_diplomacy.18.t: "Japan Requests Tariff Relief"
 JAP_diplomacy.18.d: "Tokyo has formally requested that we lift the tariffs imposed on Japanese goods. Japanese representatives hint that their government may be willing to deepen security cooperation and move further on defense policy in exchange. We must decide whether to turn this economic dispute into a strategic opportunity, or maintain the pressure."
 JAP_diplomacy.18.a: "Lift the tariffs in exchange for security concessions"
 JAP_diplomacy.18.b: "Refuse and keep the tariffs in place"
 JAP_diplomacy.19.t: "Tariffs Lifted, Security Concessions Demanded"
 JAP_diplomacy.19.d: "The United States has agreed to lift its tariffs on Japanese exports, but only as part of a broader understanding on security and defense. In practice, this means that Japan is expected to further broaden the interpretation of Article 9, deepening military cooperation with Washington and taking on a larger role in regional security."
 JAP_diplomacy.19.a: "For our economy and our alliance, we will accept this burden"
 JAP_diplomacy.20.t: "U.S. Refuses to Lift Tariffs"
 JAP_diplomacy.20.d: "Our formal request to lift the U.S. tariffs has been rejected. Washington insists that the measures will remain in place, citing domestic political pressures and unresolved disagreements over security policy. At home, frustration is growing among exporters and business leaders, while strategists warn that the dispute could further complicate our alliance."
 JAP_diplomacy.20.a: "We will have to endure the pressure for now"
 JAP_diplomacy.21.t: "Japan Requests Renewed Security Guarantees"
 JAP_diplomacy.21.d: "The Japanese government has formally requested renewed or strengthened security guarantees from the United States. Tokyo argues that the regional security environment has deteriorated and that a clearer U.S. commitment would help stabilize the situation. In private, Japanese officials acknowledge that further changes to the interpretation of Article 9 may be possible if Washington is prepared to make explicit commitments."
 JAP_diplomacy.21.a: "Restore our security guarantees in exchange for deeper commitments"
 JAP_diplomacy.21.b: "Refuse to extend our guarantees"
 JAP_diplomacy.22.t: "Security Guarantees Restored"
 JAP_diplomacy.22.d: "The United States has agreed to renew and clarify its security guarantees to Japan. In return, Washington expects Tokyo to take further steps in broadening the interpretation of Article 9 and assuming a greater share of regional security responsibilities. The alliance grows stronger, but the domestic debate over our pacifist principles will intensify."
 JAP_diplomacy.22.a: "For our security, we will accept this commitment"
 JAP_diplomacy.23.t: "U.S. Refuses Stronger Guarantees"
 JAP_diplomacy.23.d: "Our request for renewed or strengthened security guarantees has been rejected. The United States insists that existing arrangements are sufficient and that domestic political constraints limit any further commitments. Within Japan, this refusal will fuel concerns about our long-term security and the reliability of our alliance."
 JAP_diplomacy.23.a: "Then we must reconsider our own path"
 JAP_diplomacy.24.t: "Japan Requests an End to U.S. Naval Pressure"
 JAP_diplomacy.24.d: "Tokyo has formally requested that we scale back or end our heightened naval presence and pressure around key sea lanes and chokepoints. Japanese officials argue that the current posture risks escalation and undermines domestic support for the alliance. In private, they indicate that further changes to the interpretation of Article 9 may be possible if we ease our posture."
 JAP_diplomacy.24.a: "End the naval pressure in exchange for security concessions"
 JAP_diplomacy.24.b: "Maintain our naval pressure around Japan"
 JAP_diplomacy.25.t: "Naval Pressure Eased, Commitments Deepened"
 JAP_diplomacy.25.d: "The United States has agreed to ease its heightened naval presence around our sea lanes, in return for deeper security commitments from Japan. In practice, this means another step in broadening the interpretation of Article 9 and expanding our role in regional security. The alliance appears stronger, but the domestic debate over our pacifist identity will only grow more intense."
 JAP_diplomacy.25.a: "For the sake of stability, we will honor this deal"
 JAP_diplomacy.26.t: "U.S. Refuses to End Naval Pressure"
 JAP_diplomacy.26.d: "Our request to ease or end the heightened U.S. naval presence around our sea lanes has been rejected. Washington insists that the current posture is necessary in light of regional threats. At home, this refusal will fuel both fears of entrapment in a wider conflict and calls to further strengthen Japan's own defenses."
 JAP_diplomacy.26.a: "Then we must adapt under pressure"
 JAP_diplomacy.28.t: "Kaguya Lunar Design Complications"
 JAP_diplomacy.28.d: "The ambitious Kaguya lunar mission is encountering serious design challenges. Key systems are proving more complex than expected, from guidance and power management to thermal protection. Engineers argue that additional funding and time will allow them to redesign critical components and improve overall reliability, but the cost of doing so is already raising eyebrows in the cabinet."
 JAP_diplomacy.28.a: "Invest in redesign and keep the schedule tight"
 JAP_diplomacy.28.b: "Hold the line on costs and accept a longer timeline"
 JAP_diplomacy.29.t: "Kaguya Communications Vulnerabilities"
 JAP_diplomacy.29.d: "As testing continues, the Kaguya program reveals weaknesses in deep-space communications and data links. Signal integrity, bandwidth, and resistance to interference are all below target. Specialists propose new antennas, upgraded ground stations, and more robust encryption—but these improvements will require additional political and financial capital."
 JAP_diplomacy.29.a: "Upgrade the communications architecture"
 JAP_diplomacy.29.b: "Proceed with existing systems and hope for the best"
 JAP_diplomacy.30.t: "Further Delays for the Kaguya Mission"
 JAP_diplomacy.30.d: "Technical setbacks, integration issues, and scheduling conflicts with launch infrastructure have forced yet another delay to the Kaguya lunar mission. While the core systems remain promising, the project is increasingly viewed as slow and troubled. Scientists insist that patience will be rewarded, but public attention is beginning to drift elsewhere."
 JAP_diplomacy.30.a: "Accept the delay and push on toward the Moon"
 JAP_diplomacy.31.t: "Kaguya Reaches the Lunar Surface"
 JAP_diplomacy.31.d: "After years of design revisions, communications upgrades, and difficult delays, the Kaguya mission has finally succeeded. Japanese hardware now operates on and around the Moon, returning high-resolution imagery and invaluable scientific data. The achievement showcases Japan's high-tech capabilities and opens new paths for satellite development, deep-space exploration, and strategic space applications."

 JAP_diplomacy.32.d: "Engineers on the Mars mission report a recurring anomaly in the guidance software. While the issue is not yet critical, it could compound into serious navigation errors if left unaddressed. Fixing it thoroughly will pull resources from other projects and may affect the overall schedule."
 JAP_diplomacy.32.a: "Divert resources and resolve it properly"
 JAP_diplomacy.32.b: "Accept delays and patch it gradually"
 JAP_diplomacy.33.t: "Naming the Mars Colony"

 JAP_deflation_desc: "Following the 1987 Tokyo Stock Market Crash and the burst of the 1992 Asset Price Bubble, Japan's economy has been in decline. With huge government bailouts to prop up key enterprises and banks, the response to the crisis built up one of the largest public debts in the world. The bad business environment in Japan leads Japanese corporations to invest very little inside of Japan, with profits instead put into abroad or government bonds to sustain the huge debt. Due to deflation, the rise in the value of the Yen, this gives stable profits for savers even with minuscule or negative interest rates, leaving no incentives to consume or invest in the real economy. This deflation allows Japan to sustain huge debts that would make any other country bankrupt. Unfortunately, it also ensures anemic economic growth with no solution in sight."

 JAP_JP_USA_SOFA_1_desc: "U.S. forces in Japan operate under a Status of Forces Agreement that shields most personnel from Japanese courts and taxes, and gives the U.S. wide control over its bases. Local police, governors and residents must work around rules negotiated in Washington and Tokyo, and every crime, accident or noise complaint near a base is filtered through SOFA procedures before Japan can act."
 JAP_depopulation_0: "Demographic Strain (Contained)"

 JAP_depopulation_1: "Demographic Crisis (Emerging)"
 JAP_depopulation_1_desc: "Birth rates stay low and the working-age population is visibly thinning. Shopping streets in smaller cities lose tenants, local hospitals report staff shortages, and ministries quietly admit that existing pension and care formulas no longer add up."
 JAP_depopulation_2: "Demographic Crisis (Serious)"

Long-term contributors gain easier access to social insurance, family reunification and naturalisation, and some neighbourhoods now see second-generation residents who speak Japanese as their first language."
 JAP_japanese_equality: "Japanese Equality Norm"
 JAP_japanese_equality_desc: "Public debate treats full social participation by women, LGBTQ people and minorities as a mainstream expectation rather than a fringe demand. Anti-discrimination language appears in more company rules and local ordinances, and open prejudice draws louder pushback than in previous decades."
 JAP_motivated_feminism: "Motivated Feminism"
 JAP_motivated_feminism_desc: "A motivated feminist current shapes politics and workplaces. Lawsuits over harassment and pay gaps move through the courts, women's groups track statistics on board seats and promotions, and companies with visibly male-only leadership face growing public criticism."
 JAP_artificial_growth: "Artificial Growth Policies"
 JAP_artificial_growth_desc: "Economic expansion rests heavily on government and central bank support. Ultra-low interest rates, stimulus spending and targeted subsidies keep GDP figures in positive territory, even as underlying productivity and demographics would point toward stagnation without constant intervention."
 JAP_authorities_poor: "Weak Oversight Authorities"
 JAP_authorities_poor_desc: "Japan's watchdog agencies are fragmented and underpowered. Audit bodies lack staff, regulators rely on voluntary reports, and serious complaints often vanish into jurisdictional gaps between ministries and commissions."
 JAP_authorities_changing: "Reorganised Oversight Authorities"
 JAP_authorities_changing_desc: "Oversight agencies are in the middle of reorganisation. Old commissions are being merged or rebranded, mandates are rewritten, and staff move between offices while new procedures bed in, leaving supervision uneven from sector to sector."
 JAP_authorities_good: "Effective Oversight Authorities"
 JAP_authorities_good_desc: "Independent watchdogs and regulators are able to check ministries and major corporations with real authority. Audit reports are published, fines bite, and agencies have enough staff and legal tools to make misconduct materially risky."
 JAP_bureau_ombudsman: "Bureaucratic Ombudsman Office"
 JAP_bureau_ombudsman_desc: "Citizens and civil servants can bring complaints about administrative abuse to an ombudsman office outside the normal hierarchy. Patterns of misconduct inside ministries are tracked across cases, and well-documented findings are difficult for senior officials to ignore."
 JAP_bureau_forum: "Civil Service Reform Forum"
 JAP_bureau_forum_desc: "A standing forum of senior officials, outside experts and local-government representatives meets regularly to review how the bureaucracy actually works. Promotion rules, posting practices and performance metrics are debated in public reports instead of decided only behind closed doors."
 JAP_service_shocks: "Service Shockwaves"
 JAP_service_shocks_desc: "Rapid restructuring of public services sends shockwaves through the bureaucracy. Mergers, staff cuts and new performance contracts disrupt long-standing routines, and some offices struggle to keep up with basic paperwork while they adapt."
 JAP_privatization_corp: "Corporatised Public Services"
 JAP_privatization_corp_desc: "Many state functions are now delivered by semi-independent public corporations. Agencies modelled on firms handle rail, utilities and logistics under performance contracts, blurring the line between administration and business while keeping formal ownership in government hands."
 JAP_privatization_full: "Full-Scale Privatisation"
 JAP_privatization_full_desc: "Large parts of Japan's infrastructure and services have been handed to private owners. Rail lines, utilities and logistics hubs operate for profit under regulatory oversight, and ministries steer outcomes mainly through contracts and rulebooks instead of direct management."
 JAP_agriculture_land: "Regulated Farmland Ownership"
 JAP_agriculture_land_desc: "Farmland remains tightly regulated. Local committees must approve transfers, non-farm corporations face strict limits on direct ownership, and the patchwork of small family plots still shapes how rural Japan looks and farms."
 JAP_agriculture_free1: "Liberalised Farmland Market"
 JAP_agriculture_free1_desc: "Farmland rules have been loosened. Corporate operators can lease or buy larger areas more easily, and smallholders who wish to exit the sector find fewer legal obstacles when selling or consolidating their plots."
 JAP_agriculture_free2: "Open Agricultural Land Market"
 JAP_agriculture_free2_desc: "Farmland is now treated largely as a normal asset market. Big agribusinesses and investors can acquire large tracts with minimal restriction, accelerating consolidation into industrial-scale farms while traditional village patterns break up."
 JAP_accountability_flexible1: "Flexible Accountability Rules"
 JAP_accountability_flexible1_desc: "Bureaucratic accountability relies on a mix of guidelines and informal norms rather than rigid statutes. Managers have leeway to handle minor breaches internally, and formal sanctions are reserved for clear, high-profile violations."
 JAP_accountability_flexible2: "Adaptive Accountability System"
 JAP_accountability_flexible2_desc: "Oversight of civil servants is adaptive and case-based. Clear standards exist for serious misconduct, but internal review boards and ethics officers can tailor responses to context, trading some legal rigidity for speed and practicality."
 JAP_nationalized_infrastructure1: "Nationalised Core Infrastructure"
 JAP_nationalized_infrastructure1_desc: "Key transport and energy networks have been brought back under state ownership. Major rail corridors and at least one leading power utility now follow government investment plans and service obligations instead of shareholder priorities."
 JAP_green_energy: "Green Energy Transition"
 JAP_green_energy_desc: "Japan is shifting steadily toward renewable energy. Offshore wind farms, solar arrays and upgraded grid links expand each year, and utilities adjust their portfolios away from older coal and oil plants toward lower-carbon sources."
