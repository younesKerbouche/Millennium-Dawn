 australia_md.politics.10.d: "Prime Minister [?AST.GetLeader|Y] has compared his party's leadership to 'Titan II.' Sequel to the original RMS Titanic, which famously sank after being called 'unsinkable.' The comments have been met with the humorous response that perhaps his leadership should come with \"a lifeboat and a life jacket,\" given the original's fate. Social media quickly flooded with memes, suggesting the party's direction might end up \"lost at sea.\""

 AST_Final_Years_of_Howards_Second_Term_desc: "As Australia approaches the 2001 federal elections, John Howard is an unpopular prime minister, who many want to see resign or be voted out of office. There is also high dissatisfaction with the Liberal/National coalition. A big question on voters minds is if the country's second biggest airline, Ansett Australia, should be bailed out. Labour supports a bailout because it would represent a significant loss of jobs, but the ruling coalition does not since they do not see it as the governments fault."

 AST_The_Effects_of_GST: "The Effects of GST"
 AST_The_Effects_of_GST_desc: "A Goods and Services Tax, or a GST, is similar to what many Europeans would call a Value-Added Tax or (VAT). The Howard government passed legislation to establish a GST on 28 June 1999 as A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999. It gained assent on 8 July 1999 and came into operation on 1 July 2000. The government initially said that exemptions to GST were not possible, and hoped to pass the GST legislation with the support of independent Senator Harradine, but he ultimately voted against the legislation. However a compromise was eventually reached, involving most basic food items being exempt from GST, the GST on library purchases of books being refunded, a temporary 8% refund on school textbooks, increases to welfare payments, and greater powers to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission to oversee the implementation of the new tax regime."

 AST_Strengthen_the_Labor_right: "Strengthen the Labor Right"
 AST_Strengthen_the_Labor_right_desc: "Labor's Right focuses on economic growth, fiscal responsibility and market-friendly policies. Their policies prioritise budget surplus and debt reduction with more cautious climate policy and a more restrictive approach to immigration and border security. They strongly support the US alliance and close ties to Western allies."
 AST_Increase_the_power_of_the_Labor_left: "Increase the Power of the Labor Left"
 AST_Increase_the_power_of_the_Labor_left_desc: "Labor's Left is more progressive and social-democratic than the Right. The faction emphasises social justice, equality and the rights of marginalized groups.

They support a more independent foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States."
 AST_influence_the_factions: "Influence the Factions"
 AST_influence_the_factions_desc: ""
 AST_Branch_Stacking: "Branch Stacking"
 AST_Branch_Stacking_desc: "To ensure the Labor Party's success in future elections, we should position loyal party members in branches where their votes can significantly impact the outcome of internal party elections in our favour. This will allow us to ensure that our preferred candidates are preselected for elections and ensure that our faction gains control over party decisions. The practice is considered unethical and risks increasing the country's political corruption."
 AST_Influence_the_Unions: "Influence the Unions"
 AST_Influence_the_Unions_desc: "The Labor Party has a long history with Australia's labour unions. The unions have large numbers of members that could benefit our cause monetarily and politically. Supporting the unions gives us legitimacy as representatives of the working-class's interests."

 AST_Use_the_faceless_men_desc: "Senior party officials, faction leaders and union bosses exert substantial control over the party's internal processes.

 AST_Push_Social_issues_into_the_party_platform_desc: "A key priority of Labor's Left is a progressive approach to social issues. The Labor Party should make social issues a major part of our platform."
 AST_Expand_the_power_of_the_trade_unions_in_the_party: "Expand the Power of Trade Unions"
 AST_Expand_the_power_of_the_trade_unions_in_the_party_desc: "Trade unions fight for worker's rights, fair wages, job security and better working conditions. Their interests align with our own and giving them more power in the party will make them more invested in our success. We may have to compromise on some issues to keep them on our side, and the public may develop a perception that our party is under their control."
 AST_Look_towards_Keynesianism: "Look Towards Keynesianism"
 AST_Look_towards_Keynesianism_desc: "Keynesianism is an economic philosophy that is focused on aggregate demand, the idea that total demand for goods and services is the primary driver of economic activity and employment levels. The philosophy advocates for active government intervention to keep the economy stable. Countercyclical spending is a core concept that encourages governments to spend more and lower taxes during the bad times, and the reverse during economic booms. Our government should look to Keynes's wisdom when considering macroeconomic policies."

 AST_Keep_with_the_Third_way: "Keep with the Third Way"
 AST_Keep_with_the_Third_way_desc: "Traditional socialism and laissez-faire capitalism have too many flaws to be effective in the modern day.

The Labor Party will push for racial and gender equality, environmental protection and anti-imperialism. We should be wary of capitalism and decentralise political power to give communities more control over their own affairs."
 AST_Bring_Tax_reform_to_the_table: "Put Tax Reform on the Table"
 AST_Bring_Tax_reform_to_the_table_desc: "Increase taxes for the wealthy, tax cuts for the poor. A man only needs so much wealth before it becomes significant excess.

 AST_Sway_support_from_the_unions: "Persuade the Unions"
 AST_Sway_support_from_the_unions_desc: "The unions give the working man a way to balance the scales against wealthy employers. But even the unions need a representative in politics and government.

 AST_Keep_with_economic_rationalism: "Adhere to Economic Rationalism"
 AST_Keep_with_economic_rationalism_desc: "Regulation in the economy causes unnecessary inefficiencies. Let the free market decide where resources can be best spent.

 AST_Push_the_balance_of_power_towards_the_left: "Tip the Balance to the Left"
 AST_Push_the_balance_of_power_towards_the_left_desc: "The ideals of Labor's Left will become the party's primary platform. Social justice, equality and the rights of the marginalised. The weak should be raised up and the strong should be held accountable."

 AST_Push_the_balance_of_power_towards_the_right_desc: "For a fair and rational world, Labor's Right will become the party's primary concern. Economic growth, fiscal responsibility and market-friendly policies. The economy should be strong and the government should be small."

 AST_Revitalise_Labors_economic_policy: "Revitalise Labor's Economic Policy"
 AST_Revitalise_Labors_economic_policy_desc: "The country needs a new economic direction. John Howard's policies were a disaster for the country, fraught with privatisation and deregulation. Under our opponent's rule, less people than ever can afford homes and they've not so much flirted with, as stomped all over worker's rights. That's not to mention the lack of investment in public infrastructure and services which are now causing major bottlenecks in efficiency."
 AST_Refund_the_underfunded_social_services: "Reinvigorate Underfunded Social Services"
 AST_Refund_the_underfunded_social_services_desc: "Years of tight budgeting have left the country's social services in a degraded state.

 AST_Cement_a_Foreign_Policy: "Cement a Foreign Policy"
 AST_Cement_a_Foreign_Policy_desc: "Australia is a small fish in a big pond. We need to ensure we're swimming in the right direction, lest we get swallowed by a hungry shark. We need to decide who our friends are, and more importantly, who our enemies will be."

Although they still currently lack representation in the House and lack meaningful representation in the Senate, leading up to the upcoming 2001 elections, as part of our campaigning for the election, and in general, it is good for the party to promote the idea of environmental consciousness to the Australian public."
 AST_grnInfluence_the_Unions: "Influence the Unions"
 AST_grnInfluence_the_Unions_desc: "Australia has a strong history of unions, dating back to the 1853 with the Amalgamated Engineering Union, which was formed in Sydney in 1852 by 27 members of the British union who had emigrated to Australia following a work stoppage initiated by the management of a company during a labour dispute, in Britain. It may be a good idea for the Green Party to work with the unions to establish popular support amongst union members and union supporters more generally for the Australian Greens, and also to establish potential donors from the unions and their members."
