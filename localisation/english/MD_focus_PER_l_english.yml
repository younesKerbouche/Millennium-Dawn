 iranian_events.900.d: "Hello! We hope you enjoy the Iranian content. Please read the following message as it contains answers to some commonly asked questions.\n\nQ: How do I overthrow the Government?\nA: By bringing legitimacy to 0. This can be done by completing certain focuses that bring legitimacy down. The time legitimacy falls the fastest is during protests, with the first one being possible in July 2000 with the student protest event, make sure to click the option that states a protest will start!\n\nQ: I did the revolution, but I am stuck with Ayatollah Montazeri. How do I change the outlook?\nA: At the bottom of Montazeri's tree you will be presented with 2 options on how you wish to proceed with the Iranian govenrment. You can also elect any party to power after the revolution. If you went the route that triggers a civil war, just wait around 70 days.\n\nQ: How do I get sanctions lifted?\nA: Dismantling your nuclear program or getting relations with the United States above 20.\n\n----------------------\n\nWe hope you enjoy playing Iran!

Furthermore, the Supreme Leader had announced the dissolution of the Majles, Iran's official parliament. The speaker of the parliament quickly voiced his opposition, and as a result, was arrested. This move was met with outrage amongst the opposition and reformist movements, and as a result, the Supreme Leader had ordered security forces to arrest or neutralize anyone in his way.

The discussion wasn't particularly smooth, as neither party could agree on the role and job of the Shah in Iranian society. [PER.GetLeader] wished to keep the Shah's power as purely ceremonial, letting experienced bureaucrats take control of the government. The Minister however, wanting to keep the power of the secretary checked, saw things differently. He wished for a government where the power is split between him, the general secretary, the Crown Prince, and the Majles."

Once the ceremony was underway, the Imperial Crown was brought to Reza by a respected military officer. Upon putting the crown on his head, the crowd began chanting 'Javid Shah' which means Long Live the Shah. Following this, a speech commenced. 'My power is nothing without the authority of the people.

 iranian_focus.117.d: "The Iranian government has come to us asking for assistance in upgrading their aging F-14 fleet. The Iranian Air Force officers who were present gave an interesting pitch and proposals.

 iranian_focus.130.d: "A former army officer, politician, and academic. Those three words are what create the core characteristics of Ghalibaf. Perhaps being best known for his several attempts at winning the Iranian presidency, or the oligarchic tendencies he has, Ghalibaf has always positioned himself as the middle man. If an opportunity presented itself, Ghalibaf would be there to take it. He is both a principalist and a reformist, and his next moves are usually not known, unless there is money involved."

 iranian_focus.131.d: "Historically Ahmadinejad has been touted as a principalist, one of the most hardcore that there ever was. However, this conservative image of his is deemed by many as false, and instead some consider him as politically confused. This unclear position has had its benefits, as he has benefited from increased support from rural areas due to his religious affiliation, and more urban areas due to his more nationalistic tendencies. Nonetheless, Ahmadinejad remains an islamist principalist with the interests of Shia's in mind."

 iranian_focus.136.d: "Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei has been fighting to win over the support of the Iranian establishment for the longest time, but his unique political ideology continues to alienate him and his supporters. Believing that an Iranian School of Islam is needed, Mashaei consistently angers the Shi'ite Clergy who he seeks to cast out from Iranian society. On the other hand, his association with figures such as Ahmadinejad puts him at odds with Reformist movements. Still, his secular ideology and nationalistic tendencies has brought him support from the gray area within Iranian politics."

 iranian_focus.137.t: "An Army of the People"
 iranian_focus.137.d: "The Iranian Armed Forces, or the Artesh, have historically been apolitical. However, rising instability within the political establishment has left them no choice but to intervene directly and create a more stable order until the situation calms down and is ready to return to normal once more. The political direction of the Artesh is yet to be fully known, as it is made up of all sectors of Iranian society due to the majority of the active servicemen being of conscript origin."

 iranian_focus.140.d: "Earlier today, Ahmadinejad was seen pondering heavily, completely lost in his thoughts. After he was approached and asked what he was thinking about all day, he responded with 'the money we spend on the troops'. The money he is referring to is from donations for various veterans charities across Iran. Concerned with where the money was being allocated, Ahmadinejad has been debating whether to just keep the money and spend it elsewhere, or to let the money go where it was supposed to."

 iranian_focus.141.d: "To spite the mostly dominant Shi'ite clergy in the nation, we have the ability to rename some of our cities and provinces to Pre-Islamic names. Though this move would certainly anger the clerics, it will not topple their influence like we would want. Instead, this move could be considered an opening to a much grander movement to replace the clergy with God and only God himself."
 iranian_focus.141.a: "Move forward with the plan"
 iranian_focus.141.b: "We cannot risk angering the religious zealots"
 iranian_focus.142.t: "Old Habits Die Hard"
 iranian_focus.142.d: "Exposed of much corruption in his political career, Mashaei has not shyed away from any potential opportunity that could fill his pockets quick. However, now that he is in charge of the government and effectively the leader of the nation, his ways must change. If he is to properly implement his policies, then his old habits must be tossed out in favor of more ethical ones."

 iranian_focus.142.b: "Corruption is for bad men, it must be eradicated"
 iranian_focus.143.t: "The Iranian Schism"
 iranian_focus.143.d: "The Iranian government has begun reforming how Islam is fundamentally practiced. With most Muslim states, including ours, putting the Ulema and clerics in a high position, Iran is moving to dissolve the participation of the clergy in Islamic matters. They are dubbing this as the 'Iranian School' of Islam, and it's ideas have spread to our own country."
 iranian_focus.143.a: "This cannot be good"
 iranian_focus.144.t: "Iranian Trade Agreement Proposal"
 iranian_focus.144.d: "The Iranian government has proposed a possible trade agreement between our two nations. This news has come as a shock to many in our cabinet, as the current Iranian government is being headed by several former Islamic Republic officials, including their leader.

 iranian_focus.167.d: "Though our nation has not had many secession movements in recent years, it is still needed to be noted that several regions are vulnerable to foreign influence, making it possible for our enemies to exploit our regions and incite revolts. The regions of Azerbaijan, Kordestan, Balochistan, and Khuzestan are the most vulnerable."

 iranian_focus.168.d: "In the early hours of the morning, Ayatollah Montazeri quietly passed away. The nation mourns as the man who reversed the tragedies of the Islamic Revolution leaves this world behind for another. Though his passing marks a historic moment, it is still unknown what he had written in his will, and whether or not he has designated a successor to his post. The will is being read live on national television by one of his spokesmen, and in his will it has been stated that..."

Reformist movements across the nation are encouraging students across the nation to go out in demonstrations, potentially endangering national security. However, we do have the Basij and riot police at our disposal, allowing us to move into Tehran university in order to confront protesters.

 iranian_events.220.t: "The Breaking Point"
 iranian_events.220.d: "For weeks now, opposition groups have been building up steam and anticipation for today. The goal of the opposition is simple; storm the Seda va Sima broadcasting station and declare the Islamic Republic as illegitimate. About 1,000,000 people are to march towards Valiasr street in Tehran, and security forces are fearing that they would simply not be able to stop that many people. As a result, several high ranking Artesh and IRGC officials are said to be negotiating behind closed doors with the opposition groups to secure the safety of their positions and their comrades."

One of the more prominent units of the army, the 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade, also known as the NOHED brigade, have removed the insignia of the Islamic from their uniforms and military equipment. Such developments have created fear of a potential military coup or intervention against the government. Several units of the Artesh, including the NOHED brigade, have refused orders to assist with cracking down on the movement."

Montazeri is being seen as the ideal candidate for such a position due to his popularity amongst both Muslims and Secularists, thus allowing for a unified resistance movement to continue."

 iranian_events.224.t: "Formation of the Revolutionary Council of Iran"
 iranian_events.224.d: "Earlier today, a huge crowd gathered around the Tomb of Cyrus the Great, the founder of Iran. The reason for the gathering was to listen to the speech of a former minister, who is now a spokesperson for the newly formed Revolutionary Council of Iran. It has been understood that at the gathering, the revolutionary council declared that they would not be afraid to use force against the regime and its security forces who try and 'stop the will of the Iranian people'. Such a threat has not been taken lightly by elements in the IRGC, as tensions continue to mount."

 iranian_events.225.d: "Protesters and revolutionaries today stormed several government buildings, taking down portraits of Ayatollah Khomeini and Khamenei, and chanting anti-government slogans from the windows of the same buildings. In a fierce speech today, Ayatollah [PER.GetLeader] denounced those partaking in the demonstrations as agents of Israel and America, and promising to pardon those involved with the protests if they would just return home. However, his speech fell on deaf ears, and the cries on the street continue to get louder and louder."

To many in the streets, this was the Islamic Republics way of formally resigning. After decades of rule, the Islamic Republic has finally lost its grip on power. The people have flooded the streets, toppling monuments, tearing down portraits, and celebrating. The corridors of power lay dormant, with whatever comes next being unwritten."

 iranian_events.227.a: "Cowards"
 iranian_events.228.t: "Artillery Bombards Artesh Positions in Eastern Iran"
 iranian_events.228.d: "Explosions woke up locals in several cities in the east today, with Artesh positions coming under heavy bombardment, especially in Mashhad, Kerman, and Yazd. Following the first wave of initial attacks, Qasem Soleimani appeared in front of a crowd in the Imam Reza Mosque announcing that 'today, the mistakes that were made just a few weeks ago will be reversed', referring to the relocation of the Islamic Republic government. It appears the IRGC elements that fled towards the East of the country were able to regroup, and rebuild a force strong enough to push the Artesh back. Nonetheless, this will be nothing but a temporary set back."

 iranian_events.229.t: "Fighting Erupts in Eastern Iran"
 iranian_events.229.d: "Reports of heavy gunfire have been recorded in Eastern Iran, with the army coming under heavy fire by insurgents. The insurgents in question appear to be former IRGC units and officers who have rallied under General Qassem Soleimani in hopes of overthrowing the recently established government. Though the government of Iran has announced that the conflict will come to a swift end, stating that 'the government of Iran and the people of Iran trust the army to restore the integrity of Iran's borders and oust the traitors trying to destroy it'. While these claims seem to have assured some people, others are fearing that the IRGC will be able to overthrow the government, possibly ushering in a regime more hardline than that of the original Islamic Republic."
 iranian_events.229.a: "Another revolution in ruins"
 iranian_events.230.t: "Nationwide Protests Erupt in Iran"
 iranian_events.230.d: "Following incredibly unpopular government decisions by the Iranian Government earlier this week, the Iranian people have taken to the streets in droves to voice their opposition to the government and its decisions. Though some are speculating that the protests will die soon, following a common trend in Iranian uprisings, others are stating that this time around the protests could potentially lead to the toppling of the Islamic Republic system which was established through street protests like that of those that are being witnessed today. Nonetheless, the government has already began its crackdown on protesters, and videos circulating on the internet show that the security forces are not taking this movement lightly."

 iranian_events.231.d: "In the early hours of this morning, the office of the Supreme Leader announced a temporary relocation of the government to somewhere 'outside of the honorable borders of Iran'. To many in the streets of Iran, this was the Islamic Republics way of formally resigning. After decades of rule, the Islamic Republic has finally lost its grip on power. The people of Iran have flooded the streets, toppling monuments, tearing down portraits, and celebrating. The corridors of power lay dormant, with whatever comes next being unwritten. However, what is known, is that the united Iranian opposition are looking towards a democratic form of governance, one that was promised by the Islamic Republic in 1979 but never delivered upon."

 iranian_events.232.t: "Increased Calls For the Government to Resign From Opposition"
 iranian_events.232.d: "There have been increased calls for the government to resign and step down by various opposition groups. Groups ranging from the left to the right have managed to put aside their differences as a result of the insurgency in the East of the country, with many of the opposition leaders fearing for their life as a result of the advances made by former elements of the regime. It is now up to the government to determine whether or not it is appropriate to resign."

 iranian_events.233.t: "Remnants of the Fallen Regime"
 iranian_events.233.d: "With the fall of the Islamic Republic, many former government officials and affiliates saw an opportunity to capitalize on their experience in order to seize power for themselves. This includes figures such as Ahmadinejad, Mashaei, and Ghalibaf. In addition to them, the army has also began increasing its voice in the government to further their own interests. It is now time to choose who we want to lead the nation following our resignation."
 iranian_events.233.a: "Call on Ahmadinejad - Only the IRGC can defeat the IRGC"

 iranian_events.234.t: "The Heirs of Cyrus"
 iranian_events.234.d: "Iranian Shahdoms led the nation for over 2,500 years prior to the Islamic Revolution in 1979. It is for this reason that the Pahlavi dynasty has experienced relative popularity even following their overthrow in the Islamic Revolution. However, the Pan-Iranists are also monarchists to a lesser extent, and they also wish to unify the lands that were lost to the great powers. Either way, we must pick one group to hand power to once we formally resign."
 iranian_events.234.a: "The Constitutionalists - Followers of Reza Pahlavi"
 iranian_events.234.b: "The Pan-Iranists - Who seek to re-unite Iran's lost territory"
 iranian_events.235.t: "Voice of the Workers"
 iranian_events.235.d: "The Islamic Revolution was not entirely an Islamic revolution, but rather it encompassed a broad spectrum of political ideologies. The second largest being socialist and left-wing revolutionaries, they were cheated out of a say in the government following purges by Khomeini in the 80's. Either way, a socialist government will ensure good relations amongst the government and bazaars once we resign."

 iranian_events.236.d: "After weeks of heavy fighting, the IRGC have decided to lay down their arms and retreat to the country side and neighboring countries, with many choosing to go to Southern Lebanon through a secret corridor. However their cowardice is not important at this time, what matters most is that the revolution and its people have achieved ultimate victory."
 iranian_events.236.a: "As was expected"
 iranian_events.237.t: "Ayatollah Montazeri's National Address"
 iranian_events.237.d: "Stepping in front of possibly one of the largest crowds in Iranian history, perhaps larger than the ones that Ayatollah Khomeini drew, Montazeri began to wave to the crowd in front of him. Ayatollah Montazeri began his speech with a prayer, and then following it up with promises to dismantle the 'corrupt, abusive, and un-islamic institutions of the previous regime'. This statement drew loud cheers from the crowd. The 20 minute speech was televised to the whole nation, with people who were watching from home chanting pro-Montazeri out of their windows. Though so far only promises have been made, many are optimistic about the changes being promised by Ayatollah Montazeri. However, only time will tell whether or not he follows up with his promises of bringing about a new, free, and democratic Iran."
 iranian_events.237.a: "May God be with Iran"
 iranian_events.238.t: "Moderate-Liberal Islam On The Rise"
 iranian_events.238.d: "With the ascension of Ayatollah Montazeri and his followers, many liberals and moderates have begun praising the new government for bringing swift, and much needed social reform to the nation. Though the road ahead is still quite long, support for moderate and liberal forms of Islamic governance are on the rise. Party's like the Green Path Of Hope and The Freedom Movement have begun enjoying newly found support as a result of the shift in Iranian politics. Regardless though, there are still fears of a potential rise in nationalistic sentiment, especially amongst those in what has been dubbed as the 'deviant current'."

 iranian_events.239.t: "Khatami And Rafsanjani Break Silence"
 iranian_events.239.d: "Following the collapse of the Islamic Republic, many prominent reformists who took an active part in governing the Islamic Republic went silent. Two individuals in particular, Khatami and Rafsanjani, were especially silent. Mohammad Khatami has been labeled as a traitor to the Reformist movement by many students groups, as they feel betrayed that he did not side with them on both occasions that they protested against the government. They also feel that he failed to deliver what he campaigned on, democracy in Iran. Rafsanjani has also been labeled as a government stooge, and someone that also failed to bring democracy to Iran. However, in the early hours of the morning, both Khatami and Rafsanjani appeared before a crowd stating that they are willing to return to politics with the blessings of the new government."

 iranian_events.245.t: "MEK Call For Nationwide Protests"
 iranian_events.245.d: "The MEK have called for nationwide protests, and have been somehow successful in doing so to some extent. We will have the ability to suppress these protests, but at a large cost. Eitherway, this is a sign that our popularity has fallen too low."

 iranian_events.245.b: "Suppress the protests"
 iranian_events.246.t: "The MEK Attempts Assassination On a High Ranking General"
 iranian_events.246.d: "The MEK have attempted to assassinate a high ranking general, and were successful to some degree, as the general in question is now in critical condition and fighting for his life at the moment. We have the ability to save his life, though it will be quite costly."
 iranian_events.246.a: "May his soul rest in peace"
 iranian_events.246.b: "Save his life"
 iranian_events.247.t: "Hatred Against the MEK Grows"
 iranian_events.247.d: "It appears that hatred against the MEK has risen amongst our people, and the cult-like group has fallen in popularity amongst some of its members. We accredit such societal progress to our governments ability at achieving excellence in all aspects of life."
 iranian_events.247.a: "Good"
 iranian_events.247.b: "Interesting"
 iranian_events.248.t: "Defectors From the MEK Provide Assistance"
 iranian_events.248.d: "Defectors from the MEK have offered financial assistance that they had received from foreign states during the time they were still in the organization. We will take the money, and hand it out to one of our sectors in need of development."
 iranian_events.248.a: "Good"
 iranian_events.249.t: "Patriotism On the Rise Amongst Workers"
 iranian_events.249.d: "Our workers have begun working with additional vigor following fears of MEK growth. This is most likely because they have realized their lives could be even worse, and thus, they wish to keep the MEK as far as possible from any and all modes of power. "
 iranian_events.249.a: "Good"
 iranian_events.250.t: "The Armed Forces Locate and Expel MEK Cells"
 iranian_events.250.d: "The Armed Forces have found several MEK sympathizers within the defense sector, and have begun the expulsion protocol for these corrupt individuals. Though no arrests are being made by the Armed Forces, the judiciary will be handed the responsibility of dealing with these individuals further."
 iranian_events.250.a: "Good"
 iranian_events.251.t: "The MEK Denounced As Foreign Terrorist Organization"
 iranian_events.251.d: "Recently, some countries have begun designating the MEK as a foreign terrorist organization. This is most likely due to our governments rising popularity, and the MEK's lack of general support amongst the Iranian people. This is a big step forward to rooting these roaches out of our society."
 iranian_events.251.a: "Good"
 iranian_events.252.t: "The Iranian Government Collapses"
 iranian_events.252.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the Iranian government had announced its dissolution and surrendering of power. As a result, the People's Mojahedin Organization has assumed control of Tehran, and will be leading Iran moving forward. Though it is unknown why the Iranian government had decided to make such a move, it is widely understood that many, including the Ayatollah, feared assassination from the organization. It can then be inferred that the move was done to save the lives of several top government officials from being taken by the organization. Nonetheless, the move comes as a shock to many in the region, and the world."
 iranian_events.252.a: "What?"
 iranian_events.253.t: "Iran Declares Victory Over the People's Mojahedin"
 iranian_events.253.d: "The Iranian government has declared total victory over the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran following the assassination of the Rajavi family. The family in question, has been accused of running a cult-like organization since the late 60's. The PMOI (MEK) were also complicit in assisting Ba'athist Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's, thus making their rivalry with the Iranian government, and many Iranians, a fierce one. Nonetheless, the Iranian governments ability to assassinate the family and key organization leaders from abroad has shocked many around the world and inside of Iran."
 iranian_events.253.a: "Interesting"
 nuclear_iran.1.t: "Potential Suppliers?"
 nuclear_iran.1.d: "In our bid to acquire nuclear technology, we must come to terms with the fact that we simply do not meet the level sophistication required to produce adequate weapons or facilities. Thus, we must look outwards into the world and see who is willing to help us, and our sources are telling us that we can ask 2 particular nations for help..."
 nuclear_iran.1.a: "Contact the Russians"
 nuclear_iran.1.b: "Contact the North Koreans"
 nuclear_iran.2.t: "Iran Requests Assistance"
 nuclear_iran.2.d: "Iranian scientists and diplomats recently met with our own, requesting assistance with their nuclear program. They stated that they would be willing to accept anything we provide them, as long as it helps them develop their nuclear program."
 nuclear_iran.2.a: "Okay"
 nuclear_iran.2.b: "We cannot share our secrets"
 nuclear_iran.3.t: "North Korea Shares Missile Technology"

 nuclear_iran.4.d: "Russian scientists recently met with our own in [PER.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and provided us with blueprints to advanced reactors that we currently do not possess."
 nuclear_iran.4.a: "Great!"
 nuclear_iran.5.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Provide Assistance!"
 nuclear_iran.5.d: "We made a major miscalculation in contact [FROM.GetName] for assistance in our nuclear program, as they have denied our requests and have threatened to take our request to international courts, potentially exposing our secret."
 nuclear_iran.5.a: "A missed opportunity."
 nuclear_iran.6.t: "Iran Wants to Buy Missiles"
 nuclear_iran.6.d: "The Iranian government has asked us to sell them a series of Ballistic Missiles. It has declared that they will use the missiles to protect their national borders, and will not use it in any form of offensive warfare."
 nuclear_iran.6.a: "Okay, finalize the sale"
 nuclear_iran.6.b: "No"
 nuclear_iran.7.t: "Russia Sells It's Missiles"
 nuclear_iran.7.d: "Russia has sold us about 400 Ballistic Missiles. Though some of them may be dated, they still work, which is all that matters."
 nuclear_iran.7.a: "Great"
 nuclear_iran.8.t: "Russia Refuses to Sell Missiles"
 nuclear_iran.8.d: "The Russian government has denied our request to buy missiles, citing that they require them for their own military operations."
 nuclear_iran.8.a: "Okay"
 nuclear_iran.9.t: "Missiles Successfully Stolen"

 nuclear_iran.11.t: "Russia Agrees to Build SHORAD Sites"
 nuclear_iran.11.d: "The Russian government has agreed to send several engineers and construction contractors to build SHORAD sites in the south of the nation."
 nuclear_iran.11.a: "Great"
 nuclear_iran.12.t: "Russia Denies SHORAD Assistance"
 nuclear_iran.12.d: "The Russian government has rejected our pleas to send over Russian contractors and engineers to construct SHORAD sites in the south of the nation, citing our inability to pay them back in time."
 nuclear_iran.12.a: "Why?"
 nuclear_iran.13.t: "Our Terms"
 nuclear_iran.13.d: "The time has come, we have made it far enough in our nuclear program to begin negotiating with the west to finally leverage some benefits other states currently do not possess. However, despite these negotiations, we are still always more than free to pursue our own ambitions."
 nuclear_iran.13.a: "Negotiate for Monetary Benefits"
 nuclear_iran.13.b: "Negotiate for Industrial Benefits"
 nuclear_iran.13.c: "Negotiate for Energy Benefits"
 nuclear_iran.14.t: "Iran Reveals Its Nuclear Program"
 nuclear_iran.14.d: "The Iranian government has come forth with documents, photos, and other evidence proving that they currently possess the capability to produce nuclear weapons, if they don't already have them at hand. Our administration is quite perplexed by this move, as the world has speculated that the Iranians have been trying to produce nuclear weapons for some time now, with claims of this being denied by Iran. However it is suspected that Iran is doing this as a way to blackmail us and the rest of the world into giving them benefits that we otherwise would not grant them. Regardless, we will need to lift sanctions on them, and whether we do it on our own terms or theirs will still need to be decided."
 nuclear_iran.14.a: "Fine, what do they want?"
 nuclear_iran.14.b: "We will stand firm, they must dismantle all nuclear capabilities!"
 nuclear_iran.15.t: "United States Demands the Dismantling of All Nuclear Facilities and Weapons"
 nuclear_iran.15.d: "The United States has responded to our more than reasonable, and logical proposal of negotiation with a threat. They have demanded that we dismantle all of our nuclear weapons technology, as well as comply with the terms of the IAEA. However, the United States has offered to lift sanctions if we do decide to cooperate with them, but this is just not the way we expected them to react."
 nuclear_iran.15.a: "Fine, we will comply"
 nuclear_iran.15.b: "With that attitude? We will pursue our nuclear weapons!"
 nuclear_iran.16.t: "Iran Complies"
 nuclear_iran.16.d: "The Iranian government has agreed to comply with our terms on the matter of nuclear weapons. They will have exactly 6 months to de-nuclearize their nation, which includes changing their doctrine and destroying any and all stockpiles of nuclear weapons if they have any."
 nuclear_iran.16.a: "Good"
 nuclear_iran.17.t: "Iran Rebuffs Our Terms"
 nuclear_iran.17.d: "The Iranian government has decided that it wants to play with fire, and has decided that it wants to reject our generous offer. As a result, we will be able to pursue several options at hand, from sanctions to outright intervention."
 nuclear_iran.17.a: "Sanctions on their industries, and key persons of interest"
 nuclear_iran.17.b: "Sanctions, and military intervention against their facilities!"
 nuclear_iran.17.c: "We should just leave them alone"
 nuclear_iran.18.t: "United States Calls for Intervention Against Iran"
 nuclear_iran.18.d: "The United States has recently declared the Iran has crossed a redline that it should not have. This is primarily because of the discovery of the Iranian nuclear program, and its refusal to comply with the United States terms. We are asked to sanction the Iranian regime, and assist with pressuring Iran into pressure."
 nuclear_iran.18.a: "Okay"
 nuclear_iran.18.b: "This is a clear violation of international law!"
 nuclear_iran.19.t: "International Sanctions"
 nuclear_iran.19.d: "It appears that the world has decided to turn against us, and have placed sanctions on our economy which will inevitably grind it to a halt. We will need to evaluate our policies."
 nuclear_iran.19.a: "What did we expect from a world of traitors?"
 nuclear_iran.20.t: "Iranian Nuclear Program Exposed"
 nuclear_iran.20.d: "Now that the Iranian nuclear program has been exposed, we are forced to react. We must demand that Iran surrenders its nuclear weaponry as soon as possible in order to lift the sanctions that we are about to call on them."
 nuclear_iran.20.a: "Sanctions, sanctions, sanctions!"
 nuclear_iran.21.t: "United States Demands Nuclear Disarmament"
 nuclear_iran.21.d: "Following the exposure of our nuclear program, the United States has declared that we need to rid the state of all nuclear weaponry and get back to the negotiating table in order to get the sanctions that we currently have on our government removed."
 nuclear_iran.21.a: "We will see"
 nuclear_iran.22.t: "Iran Offers Cheap Oil"
 nuclear_iran.22.d: "Iran has offered its oil to us at a discounted price. This is as a result of crippling sanctions placed upon them by Western powers, and their friends. This has crippled Iran's economy, and as a result, they are forced to sell off their oil at a cheaper price."

 nuclear_iran.22.b: "No"
 nuclear_iran.23.t: "China Buys Our Oil!"
 nuclear_iran.23.d: "The Chinese government has agreed to buy our oil at a discounted price, helping our economy stay afloat."

 nuclear_iran.25.a: "We will resist!"
 nuclear_iran.26.t: "United States Decreases Economic Pressure"
 nuclear_iran.26.d: "The United States has chosen that it wants to decrease the amount of sanctions they have put on our people. Whether they maintain this stance is something that we will have to wait and see."
 nuclear_iran.26.a: "Good"
 nuclear_iran.27.t: "Iran Begins Acting Erratically"
 nuclear_iran.27.d: "Iran has once more began acting more like a pariah state instead of a civilized one. We must reconsider our stance on sanctions."
 nuclear_iran.27.a: "They asked for it"
 nuclear_iran.28.t: "Iran Falls in Line"
 nuclear_iran.28.d: "In a complete 180 of typical Iranian policy, they appear to be moving towards a more peaceful and controlled direction."
 nuclear_iran.28.a: "Good, maybe we can ease sanctions now"
 nuclear_iran.29.t: "The United States Lifts Sanctions!"
 nuclear_iran.29.d: "The day has come, President [USA.GetLeader] announced that they would be lifting all economic sanctions against our nation. This is a day we have long awaited, and our dreams have finally come. The time has come for us to put aside our differences, and reconcile with the Americans."
 nuclear_iran.29.a: "A great day"

 # Leader Descriptions
 PER_khamenei_desc: "Khamenei was born in 1939 in Mashhad to a family of Azeri descent. The future Ayatollah chose to focus on theology, studying under influential clerics such as Khomeini. By the 60's and 70's, Khamenei was active against the Shah and fell in trouble with the SAVAK, being arrested as a result. After the Islamic revolution, he chose to help with the war effort against the Iraqi invasion, and participated in mobilizing people to defend the nation. Khamenei was active in shaping the new government, eventually being elected as the 3rd president of the Islamic Republic. Following the disinheritance of Montazeri, Khamenei was the chosen successor to Ayatollah Khomeini. Though still incredibly conservative, some consider Khamenei as a reformist in comparison to Khomeini, as he chose to lift many restrictions placed on things such as music following the 1979 revolution. He is also known for his tampering of politics, where if one camp grows too strong he tries to strengthen the other."
 PER_mashaei_desc: "Born in Mazandaran, Mashaei played a role in quelling the 1979 Kurdish revolt following the Iranian Revolution. Being a former intelligence officer during this conflict, Mashaei was able to meet individuals such as Ahmadinejad whom he became friends with, later allowing him to catapult his political career into the spotlight. Holding relatively unorthodox views in comparison to other Iranian Principalists, Mashaei believes that the clergy has grown too strong and must be weakened in Iranian society, both religiously and politically. Wanting to bring about a mix of Islamic Nationalism and Pre-Islamic Iranian nationalism, Mashaei and his clique are labeled by the Clergy as an individual with 'Deviant Tendancies'."
 PER_montazeri_desc: "Born in Najafabad, Isfahan, Montazeri was educated by a Grand Marja, one of the highest authorities in Shia islam. Montazeri was also one of the leaders of the Islamic Revolution that toppled the Shah in 1979. As a Grand Ayatollah, Montazeri was appointed as the successor to Ayatollah Khomeini upon his death. However, things took a different turn, and the revolution did not play out to what Montazeri had envisioned. Instead of a democracy which included all sectors of Iranian politics, there were hand picked and vetted individuals. Certain groups were prohibited from running or participating in election, and many parties were banned. Following the 1988 mass execution of various leftists in Iran, Montazeri spoke out in opposition to the government and criticized Khomeini's actions, thus resulting in him being disinherited by Khomeini. Ever since, Montazeri actively worked against the regime and called for its toppling, calling for the construction of a new non-islamic regime."
 PER_pahlavi_desc: "Born in Tehran as the Crown Prince, and heir to the Peacock throne, Reza experienced a life of royalty in his early years. Often being a moderate in comparison to his father, taking steps such as pardoning enemies of the state or calling for more liberal changes, Reza did not directly inherit the throne. While he was in the United States, training to become a fighter jet pilot, the Islamic Revolution of 1979 ousted his father, and a 2,500 year tradition of Iranian Shahdoms. With the collapse of the Imperial State of Iran, Reza had no choice but to stay in the United States and live a life of exile. Many of his supporters inside of Iran chose to flee to other western states, such as those in Europe or the Americas. He did not entirely abandon all hope for the throne, as until the mid 1980's, he was receiving funding from the CIA to pursue activities against the Islamic Republic. This all ended following the Iran Contra affair. This did not spell the end of his resolve of overthrowing the Islamic Republic, instead Reza focused on uniting Iranians through campaigns of resistance against the Islamic Republic, in a bid to overthrow it."
 PER_homayoon_desc: "Born on the 27th of September, 1928, Homayoon began his political activities at the young age of fourteen. Being a part of several political parties and movements, he was an early supporter of Mohammad Mossadegh. His political involvement was not limited to just Mossadegh, as he was involved in SUMKA, the fascist party which was led by a former member of the S.S., Monshizadeh. Homayoon was also involved with several Pan-Iranist organizations, and his political leanings eventually starting leaning right. He eventually became the minister of Information and Tourism, which allowed him to gain enough favor with the Imperial State to become the deputy secretary general of the Rastakhiz party, the state party of Iran in the 70's. Following the revolution, Homayoon fled to France, where he pursued activities against the Islamic Republic. Homayoon seeked to create a liberal order in Iran, and thus helped found the Constitutionalist Party of Iran, which aimed to restore a constitutional monarchy under Reza Pahlavi II. This did not mean Homayoon was a staunch monarchist, or supporter of Pahlavi, as there had been instances of criticisms aimed at Pahlavi by Homayoon."

# Ideas for Separatism systems
 # Based on the influence of the following nations, they will get decisions to launch fully-armed uprisings that will have a mission activate which will give Iran a limited time quell it. If it fails to do so in a timely manner, a peace deal will be forced, else Iran will receive increased sanctions if it keeps fighting. May even lose the core(s).
 # Saudi's - Insurrections in Arabistan
 # Turkey/Azerbaijan - Insurrections in Azerbaijan (Iranian)
 # Israel - Insurrection in Kordestan
 # These will be visible as state modifiers, influencing nations will get an event letting them know it's possible

# Ideas for protest system
# - Protests can come from events, focuses, etc. They will be scripted
# - Although the events will be scripted, the actual protests will not be
# - Before a protest breaks out, depending on the scale, it will be assigned 3 tiers
# - Tier 1 is small, regional protest
# - Tier 2 is a medium, regional protest that can grow to a tier 3
# - Tier 3 is a large, revolutionary movement that can topple the government
# - If more than 12 states fall, the government could resign
# - Each time a state falls, the balance of power moves closer to collapse
# - State will fall at random
# - To resolve a protest, you need to deploy security forces
# - Success from security forces will be based on army internal faction opinion
# - Lower opinion will mean lower chance of success
# - If I.R. collapses on the BOP, then an event chain where the government falls starts

# Ideas for MEK mechanic
# Will have 3 phases based on government popularity & support
# Phase 1 - high government popularity/legitimacy will mean the MEK will not do a whole lot, and if you locate where their base is, you can sabotage them out of their host country
# Phase 2 - Medium government popularity/legitimacy will mean the MEK will try and assassinate scientists, generals, sabotage factories, etc
# Phase 3 - Low government popularity/legitimacy will mean the MEK will try and start nationwide protests, support Kurdish independence, and attempt coups
