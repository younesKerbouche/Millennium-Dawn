 # Tribal Path Events (chad.350-369)
 chad.350.t: "Tribal Parliament Formation"
 chad.350.d: "The time has come to formalize the role of traditional leaders in our governance. A Tribal Parliament will bring together elders from all major ethnic groups - Zaghawa, Arab, Sara, and Toubou - to deliberate on national affairs. The question remains: should this parliament wield genuine authority, or serve as an advisory body to the state?"
 chad.350.a: "Grant the parliament full traditional authority."
 chad.350.b: "Establish it as an advisory council."

 chad.351.t: "Nomadic Crisis"
 chad.351.d: "Severe drought has struck the Sahel, devastating the nomadic herders who traverse our northern territories. Their livestock are dying, water sources have dried up, and entire communities face starvation. Traditional routes between seasonal pastures have become death marches. These nomads are our people, and they look to the government for salvation."
 chad.351.a: "Dispatch emergency aid to the nomads."
 chad.351.b: "They must endure as they always have."

 chad.352.t: "Desert Cavalry Formed"
 chad.352.d: "The fierce mounted warriors of Chad's northern tribes have offered to form specialized cavalry units for the national military. These men are born to the saddle, experts in desert warfare who can traverse terrain where conventional forces cannot operate. Their traditional fighting spirit could be harnessed for modern military purposes."
 chad.352.a: "Establish elite desert cavalry units."
 chad.352.b: "Integrate them into standard forces."

 chad.353.t: "Traditional Justice System Established"
 chad.353.d: "For centuries, disputes among our people have been resolved through traditional justice administered by tribal elders. These customary courts command deep respect in rural communities, often more than state judges sent from the capital. The question now is whether to grant these traditional courts legal authority, or maintain them alongside the state judicial system."
 chad.353.a: "Grant traditional courts full legal authority."
 chad.353.b: "Allow a parallel justice system."

 chad.354.t: "Tribal Land Rights Codified"
 chad.354.d: "Land ownership in Chad has always been a matter of tribal custom and ancestral claims rather than written deeds. Now there are calls to formally recognize these traditional land rights in law, protecting tribal territories from exploitation and encroachment. This could resolve longstanding disputes, but also challenges the state's ultimate sovereignty over national territory."
 chad.354.a: "Enshrine tribal land rights in law."
 chad.354.b: "Recognize rights through customary agreements."

 chad.355.t: "Inter-Tribal Marriage Alliance"
 chad.355.d: "In a development that could heal old wounds, the families of prominent Zaghawa and Arab leaders have proposed a marriage alliance between their children. Such unions historically served to bind tribes together and end blood feuds. This alliance could become a powerful symbol of national unity, if conservative elders can be convinced to embrace it."
 chad.355.a: "Celebrate this alliance publicly."
 chad.355.b: "The elders will not approve."

 chad.356.t: "Nomadic Integration Program"
 chad.356.d: "The nomadic peoples of northern Chad have lived largely outside the reach of the modern state, following ancient migration patterns and traditional ways of life. A comprehensive integration program would bring education, healthcare, and economic opportunities to these communities while respecting their cultural identity and mobility."
 chad.356.a: "Launch a fully-funded integration program."
 chad.356.b: "Let traditional councils manage integration."

 chad.357.t: "Tribal Trade Networks Established"
 chad.357.d: "For millennia, trade routes have crisscrossed the Sahel, connecting communities through networks of exchange maintained by traditional traders. These informal networks move goods efficiently across vast distances, but operate outside state control and taxation. Formalizing these tribal trade networks could boost economic development while respecting commercial traditions."
 chad.357.a: "Formalize the tribal trade networks."
 chad.357.b: "Keep trade informal to avoid disputes."

 chad.358.t: "Pastoral Development Success"
 chad.358.d: "Our pastoral development programs have achieved remarkable results.

 chad.358.a: "A triumph for our people."

 chad.359.t: "Tribal Resource Sharing Agreement"
 chad.359.d: "Water, grazing land, and mineral resources have long been sources of conflict between Chad's ethnic groups. Now tribal leaders have come together to negotiate a comprehensive resource-sharing agreement that would distribute these vital assets equitably. Such an agreement could end generations of conflict - or simply codify existing power imbalances."
 chad.359.a: "Sign an agreement binding all tribes."
 chad.359.b: "Limit sharing to allied tribal groups."

 chad.360.t: "Tribal Defense Pact Signed"
 chad.360.d: "The warrior traditions of Chad's tribes have often been turned against each other in bloody feuds. Now there is an opportunity to unite these martial peoples in defense of the nation. A tribal defense pact would commit all major clans to mutual protection, creating a formidable force that no enemy would dare challenge."
 chad.360.a: "Unite all clans under one banner."
 chad.360.b: "Form a northern tribal confederacy."

 chad.361.t: "Cross-Border Tribal Agreement"
 chad.361.d: "Many of Chad's ethnic groups straddle colonial borders, with kin living in neighboring nations. Toubou communities extend into Libya and Niger, while Arabs and Zaghawa have relatives across multiple frontiers. A cross-border tribal agreement would recognize these traditional connections, potentially strengthening regional ties - or threatening national sovereignty."
 chad.361.a: "Sign cross-border tribal agreements."
 chad.361.b: "Restrict such agreements for sovereignty."

 chad.362.t: "Sahel Tribal Alliance Summit"
 chad.362.d: "Tribal leaders from across the Sahel have gathered in N'Djamena for an unprecedented summit. Representatives from Chad, Mali, Niger, and beyond are discussing cooperation on security, trade, and cultural preservation.

 chad.362.a: "Forge a comprehensive Sahel alliance."
 chad.362.b: "Achieve limited bilateral agreements."

 chad.363.t: "Tribal Golden Age Declared"

The nation celebrates this remarkable achievement."
 chad.363.a: "A golden age dawns for Chad."

 chad.364.t: "Confederation of Peoples Established"
 chad.364.d: "The ultimate expression of tribal governance has been achieved: the Confederation of Peoples. This new constitutional framework establishes Chad not as a nation-state but as a voluntary union of ethnic communities, each retaining autonomy while cooperating on matters of common interest. It is a radical experiment in post-colonial African governance."
 chad.364.a: "Establish a strong confederation."
 chad.364.b: "Maintain limited central authority."

 chad.365.t: "Toubou Reconciliation Ceremony"
 chad.365.d: "The proud Toubou people of northern Chad have long been alienated from the southern-dominated government. Now their traditional leaders have agreed to a reconciliation ceremony, a sacred ritual in which past grievances are forgiven and new bonds of trust established. If successful, this could finally integrate the fierce warriors of Tibesti into the national project."
 chad.365.a: "Embrace the reconciliation fully."
 chad.365.b: "Some clans remain skeptical."

 chad.366.t: "Tribal Education Initiative"
 chad.366.d: "Chad's rich oral traditions - epic poems, genealogies, and historical knowledge passed down through generations - are endangered by modernization. A tribal education initiative would preserve these traditions by integrating them into schools, ensuring that young Chadians learn their cultural heritage alongside modern subjects."
 chad.366.a: "Focus on preserving oral traditions."
 chad.366.b: "Build modern schools alongside traditional learning."

 chad.367.t: "Traditional Medicine Revival"
 chad.367.d: "For countless generations, traditional healers have treated illness using medicinal plants, spiritual practices, and accumulated wisdom. While modern medicine offers powerful tools, many rural Chadians still trust the old ways. A traditional medicine revival would validate these practices and potentially integrate valuable indigenous knowledge with scientific healthcare."
 chad.367.a: "Promote traditional medicine nationally."
 chad.367.b: "Integrate traditional and modern healthcare."

 chad.368.t: "Customary Law Recognized"
 chad.368.d: "The legal systems imposed by colonialism often conflict with the customary law that has governed Chad's peoples for centuries. From marriage customs to inheritance rules to conflict resolution, traditional practices differ markedly from written statutes. Formally recognizing customary law would validate these traditions, but create complex questions about legal authority and jurisdiction."
 chad.368.a: "Recognize customary law as equal to state law."
 chad.368.b: "Grant customary law advisory status only."

 chad.369.t: "Nomadic Rights Charter"
 chad.369.d: "The nomadic peoples of Chad have always moved freely across vast territories, following seasonal patterns established over millennia. Modern borders, property rights, and state authority often conflict with this way of life. A Nomadic Rights Charter would guarantee freedom of movement and protect traditional migration routes, recognizing that Chad's desert peoples cannot be sedentary."
 chad.369.a: "Guarantee complete freedom of movement."
 chad.369.b: "Allow movement with seasonal restrictions."

 # Pan-African Path Events (chad.380-399)
 chad.380.t: "CEMAC Reform Summit"
 chad.380.d: "The Central African Economic and Monetary Community faces calls for reform and deeper integration. As a member state, Chad must decide whether to push for a more unified economic and political bloc that could rival the influence of former colonial powers, or to maintain current arrangements that preserve national sovereignty at the cost of collective strength."
 chad.380.a: "Push for comprehensive CEMAC reform."
 chad.380.b: "Accept modest reforms only."

 chad.381.t: "Common Market Launched"
 chad.381.d: "A proposal has been advanced to create a true common market across Central Africa, eliminating all tariffs and trade barriers between member states. This would create a massive regional economy and boost trade, but would require surrendering control over national trade policy and exposing domestic industries to foreign competition."
 chad.381.a: "Launch the common market immediately."
 chad.381.b: "Phase in tariff reductions gradually."

 chad.382.t: "Free Movement Agreement"
 chad.382.d: "The borders drawn by colonialism divided ethnic groups and disrupted ancient trade and migration patterns. A free movement agreement would allow citizens of member states to cross borders without restriction, reuniting divided peoples and facilitating commerce. However, concerns about security and national identity make this a sensitive issue."
 chad.382.a: "Open all borders completely."
 chad.382.b: "Allow movement for workers only."

 chad.383.t: "Pan-African Army Formation"
 chad.383.d: "The vision of a unified Pan-African military force is gaining momentum. Such an army would enable African nations to handle continental security without relying on foreign intervention. Chad's battle-hardened forces would form a core component, but this would require surrendering some military sovereignty to a supranational command structure."
 chad.383.a: "Commit Chad as a key contributor."
 chad.383.b: "Provide only token forces."

 chad.384.t: "Anti-Colonial Liberation Support"
 chad.384.d: "Liberation movements fighting against colonial or neo-colonial domination across Africa have requested Chad's support. Providing aid to these movements would advance the Pan-African cause and strike at imperialism, but would also strain our resources and provoke retaliation from powerful foreign interests."
 chad.384.a: "Provide full support to liberation movements."
 chad.384.b: "Express solidarity without material aid."

 chad.385.t: "Peacekeeping Force Deployed"
 chad.385.d: "A neighboring African nation has descended into civil war, and the continental community has called for a peacekeeping intervention. Chadian forces are battle-tested and respected, making our participation crucial to the mission's success. This would demonstrate regional leadership but commit our troops to a dangerous and potentially lengthy deployment."
 chad.385.a: "Deploy peacekeeping forces immediately."
 chad.385.b: "Limit contribution to logistical support."

 chad.386.t: "Kanem-Bornu Border Restoration"
 chad.386.d: "The medieval Kanem-Bornu Empire once dominated the Lake Chad Basin, ruling territories that span modern Chad, Nigeria, Niger, and Cameroon. Some Pan-Africanists argue that restoring these historical borders would correct the arbitrary divisions imposed by colonialism. This vision appeals to historical pride but would challenge the sovereignty of neighboring nations."
 chad.386.a: "Claim the Kanem-Bornu legacy."
 chad.386.b: "Honor the legacy through cultural cooperation."

 chad.387.t: "Lake Chad Basin Authority Established"
 chad.387.d: "Lake Chad is shared by four nations and its shrinking waters affect millions. Establishing a Lake Chad Basin Authority with real power to manage water resources and coordinate development would benefit the entire region. The question is whether Chad should lead this organization or participate as an equal partner."
 chad.387.a: "Lead the Basin Authority."
 chad.387.b: "Join as an equal partner."

 chad.388.t: "Imperial Administration Restored"
 chad.388.d: "Drawing on the legacy of pre-colonial African empires, there is a proposal to restore imperial administrative structures adapted for modern governance. This would blend the hierarchical organization and ceremonial traditions of African monarchies with contemporary bureaucracy, creating a uniquely African form of state administration."
 chad.388.a: "Restore imperial administrative traditions."
 chad.388.b: "Preserve imperial culture only."

 chad.389.t: "Negritude Cultural Movement"
 chad.389.d: "The Negritude movement, celebrating African cultural identity and rejecting colonial cultural domination, has found new life in Chad. Intellectuals, artists, and activists are calling for a renaissance of African cultural pride, emphasizing indigenous languages, art forms, and philosophies over those imposed by colonialism."
 chad.389.a: "Embrace Negritude as national identity."
 chad.389.b: "Support cultural revival alongside modernization."

 chad.390.t: "Pan-African University Founded"
 chad.390.d: "There is a proposal to establish a Pan-African University in N'Djamena, drawing students and scholars from across the continent. This institution would teach African history, languages, and philosophies while training the next generation of continental leaders. It would be expensive but would elevate Chad's intellectual and diplomatic standing."
 chad.390.a: "Found the Pan-African University."
 chad.390.b: "Partner with existing institutions instead."

 chad.391.t: "African Languages Revival"
 chad.391.d: "French and Arabic dominate government and education in Chad, while indigenous African languages are relegated to informal use. A language revival movement proposes elevating Sara, Kanuri, and other native tongues to official status, conducting government business and education in African languages rather than those of former colonizers."
 chad.391.a: "Replace colonial languages entirely."
 chad.391.b: "Promote African languages alongside colonial ones."

 chad.392.t: "Decolonize Minds Campaign"
 chad.392.d: "True independence requires not just political sovereignty but mental liberation from colonial thinking. A 'Decolonize Minds' campaign would reshape education to emphasize African perspectives, challenge Eurocentric narratives, and instill pride in indigenous knowledge systems. Critics warn this could isolate Chad from global discourse."
 chad.392.a: "Reshape education comprehensively."
 chad.392.b: "The campaign receives mixed support."

 chad.393.t: "United States of Africa Proposed"
 chad.393.d: "The ultimate Pan-African vision: a United States of Africa, a single continental nation replacing the artificial states created by colonialism. This ambitious proposal envisions a federal government in which current nations would become provinces of a unified African superstate. It is a revolutionary idea that both inspires and frightens."
 chad.393.a: "Champion the United States of Africa."
 chad.393.b: "Propose gradual confederation instead."

 chad.394.t: "Continental Parliament Session"
 chad.394.d: "The Continental Parliament, representing nations across Africa, has convened to advance Pan-African integration. Delegates debate everything from common currency to freedom of movement to mutual defense. Chad's representatives have an opportunity to shape this agenda - or to watch it collapse into gridlock."
 chad.394.a: "Advance the Pan-African agenda."
 chad.394.b: "The session ends in disagreement."

 chad.395.t: "African Currency Launch"
 chad.395.d: "The CFA Franc, a remnant of French colonial control, has long been criticized as a tool of neo-colonial economic domination. A proposal has emerged to replace it with a new African currency free from European control. This would assert economic sovereignty but also create uncertainty and require abandoning the franc's stability."
 chad.395.a: "Adopt the new African currency."
 chad.395.b: "Join a regional currency zone first."

 chad.396.t: "Pan-African Defense Treaty"
 chad.396.d: "A comprehensive Pan-African Defense Treaty would commit signatory nations to mutual military assistance, creating a collective security architecture independent of foreign powers. An attack on one African nation would be treated as an attack on all. This would provide security but also risk entangling Chad in distant conflicts."
 chad.396.a: "Sign with mutual defense clause."
 chad.396.b: "Sign with non-binding cooperation only."

 chad.397.t: "African Renaissance Declaration"
 chad.397.d: "After years of Pan-African organizing and cultural revival, the moment has come to declare an African Renaissance - a new era of continental unity, cultural pride, and self-determination. This declaration would signal to the world that Africa has shed the legacy of colonialism and claims its rightful place among the great civilizations of history."
 chad.397.a: "Declare the African Renaissance."

 chad.398.t: "AU Leadership Bid"
 chad.398.d: "The African Union chairmanship is rotating to a new nation, and Chad has been nominated. Leading the AU would elevate Chad's diplomatic status and allow us to shape continental policy. However, it would also require significant resources and diplomatic capital, and carries the risk of failure on a very public stage."
 chad.398.a: "Launch Chad's bid for AU leadership."
 chad.398.b: "Support an allied candidate instead."

 chad.399.t: "Sahel Unity Summit"
 chad.399.d: "A historic summit has convened in N'Djamena bringing together the nations of the Sahel to forge lasting unity. The challenges facing our region - terrorism, climate change, poverty - can only be addressed through collective action. This summit could create an unbreakable regional bloc, or merely produce empty declarations that change nothing."
 chad.399.a: "Forge unbreakable regional bonds."
 chad.399.b: "Establish a framework for future cooperation."

 # Foreign Patron Events
 chad.700.t: "French Military Demands"

 chad.711.t: "Sahel Crisis Response"

 chad.711.b: "Send financial aid instead."
 chad.711.c: "Offer only diplomatic support."

 chad.712.t: "AU Chairmanship Bid"
