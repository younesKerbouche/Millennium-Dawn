 libyan_tribalism_tripolitania_tooltip_delayed: "Tripolitania serves as the center of Libyan politics and governance. Tripolitania has a long history of resistance against occupiers, as after World War I it declared independence from Italy as the 'Tripolitanian Republic'. While the independence wasn't successful, it was the first republican government of the Arab world. The Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, was born in Tripolitania near the city of Sirte. With his rise to power, Gaddafi's own Qadhadfa tribe has seen an increase in power as many of Gaddafi's elite soldiers are recruited from them and other Tripolitanian tribes."
 libyan_tribalism_cyrenaica_tooltip: "§Y[CYR.GetNameWithFlag]§!"
 libyan_tribalism_cyrenaica_tooltip_delayed: "Cyrenaica has a long history as an independent nation, and can be considered the birthplace of the modern Libyan nation. Under the Ottoman rule, the region had great autonomy. Once the region was given to the Italians, Sheikh Idris of the Senussi order was given the title of Emir of Cyrenaica. While stripped of title later by the Italians, the Emir gained back control of the region after World War II at the consent of the British. Two years later, the entirety of Libya was united under the Emirate of Cyrenaica as a Kingdom, with Emir Idris becoming King Idris I. Ever since the fall of the monarchy, Cyrenaica has been the strongest supporter of bringing it back with occasional nationalist activity against Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nThe south of Cyrenaica is inhabited by the Toubou people, a nomadic African ethnic group that inhabit Southern Libya, Northern Chad and Northern Niger."

In addition to Arabs, Fezzan also hosts a small Toubou minority and it is also the home of Libyan Tuaregs. The long distances and harsh terrain make the region very difficult to assert control over."

 LBA_muammar_gaddafi_desc: "Muammar Gaddafi took power in Libya after overthrowing the Libyan monarchy in 1969. He quickly took control of the entire ruling apparatus, and implemented a mix of policies between anti-Western ideals, Islamic socialism and sharia, and Arab nationalism. He eventually concentrated his ideas into the Green Book, which outlined his Third International Theory. While initially a popular leader at home and abroad, Gaddafi became increasing sidelined from international politics. Constant funding of terrorists, revolutionaries and insurgents has left Gaddafi with very few friends on the international stage. Gaddafi's actions have left the once oil rich nation of Libya suffering under international pressure and sanctions, and is at the risk of becoming an international pariah."

Many of his matches were fixed in his favour, and announcers in matches were forbidden from announcing anyone else but him by name, others would only be announced by their jersey number. Generally, Al-Saadi is seen as the black sheep of the family, and there are rumours that he was forced to marry a military commander's daughter to silence talk of his possible bisexuality."

Many of his political followers have been members of Al-Qaeda and the LIFG, so whether his true allegiance rests with the Brotherhood or a more extremist form of Islam is unclear."
 LBA_abdelhakim_belhaj_desc: "Abdelhakim Belhaj founded the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group in the 1980s, with the goal of getting rid of Muammar Gaddafi. However, before being able to do anything, the LIFG was already driven out of the country.

 LBA_foreign_food_imports: "食料輸入"
 LBA_foreign_food_imports_desc: "無理に農業にこだわるのは無意味だ。リビアは自給自足の農業に適した国ではない。我々は堅実な貿易ネットワークを構築し、他国からの安定的な食料供給を確保すべきである。外国依存度は高まるが、国内農業の問題を回避できる。"

 LibyaTribes.2.d: "我々の海軍に所属する[tribal_offender]出身の将校が、非常に有望な活躍を見せている。彼は急速に昇進を重ねてきたが、現在はさらなる昇進において壁にぶつかっているようだ。軍上層部には、この[tribal_offender]人将校にこれ以上の権力を与えたくないという私的な事情があるらしい。我々が介入し、軍に昇進を強制させることもできる。この措置は[tribal_offender]部族からの支持を得る助けにもなるだろう。あるいは、軍の判断を黙って受け入れることもできる。"
 LibyaTribes.2.a: "彼らは昇進に値する"
 LibyaTribes.2.b: "我々が介入するような問題ではない"

 LibyaTribes.4.d: "リビアの大学に通う[tribal_offender]出身の学生が、新しい技術に関する論文を発表した。この論文は我々の産業部門の発展に寄与する可能性がある。しかし、その中には現在の政権に対する批判や、他部族がリビアの進歩を妨げているという主張も含まれている。この論文を抑圧すべきか、それとも公表を許すべきか？"
 LibyaTribes.4.a: "この論文は良い知らせだ"
 LibyaTribes.4.b: "公表を抑圧せよ"
 LibyaTribes.5.t: "経済学者が解決策を提案"
 LibyaTribes.5.d: "[tribal_offender]部族出身の経済学者が最近、出版物の中で、一部の税を削減すればリビアの経済生産性が向上すると述べた。偶然にも、この税制改革は[tribal_offender]部族にとって重要な経済部門に有利に働く内容である。彼の主張には一定の正当性があるが、これに従えば、[tribal_offender]部族を優遇していると他部族から見られるリスクがある。"
 LibyaTribes.5.a: "国家経済が最優先だ"
 LibyaTribes.5.b: "他部族への配慮を優先しよう"
 LibyaTribes.6.t: "地方政治家が改革を提案"
 LibyaTribes.6.d: "「私は[tribal_offender]の村で育ちました。子供の頃、地域の長老たちはコミュニティの運営をしっかり行っていました。それに比べて、今の政府はそのようなことができていません。」——最近、[tribal_offender]出身の地方政治家がテレビインタビューでリビア国家の改善案を問われた際の発言である。彼のインタビューでは、国家を近代化するための良い提案がいくつか述べられていた。その改革を採用すれば国にとって有益だが、政権としての面目を多少失うことになるだろう。"
 LibyaTribes.6.a: "彼のアイデアは気に入った"
 LibyaTribes.6.b: "彼は自分の立場をわきまえるべきだ"
 LibyaTribes.7.t: "部族長老たちに反逆罪の疑い"
 LibyaTribes.7.d: "[tribal_offender]部族出身の革命委員会の情報提供者が、「2人の部族長老が反革命的な発言を交わし、敵対勢力と接触して機密情報を共有している」との情報を提供してきた。この情報のすべてを確認することはできていないが、事実であれば深刻な問題である。とはいえ、情報提供者が自分の部族の地位を高めるために虚偽の告発をしている可能性も否定できない。"
 LibyaTribes.7.a: "この2人の長老を排除せよ"
 LibyaTribes.7.b: "この情報提供者の言葉は信用できない"
 LibyaTribes.8.t: "多額の寄付"
 LibyaTribes.8.d: "数人の[tribal_offender]出身ビジネスマンが政府に接触してきた。政府が「ビジネスに優しい法整備」を検討してくれるなら、日々の行政運営に使える多額の寄付金を提供するという。彼らの提案内容を確認すると、その多くが[tribal_offender]の利益に直結する内容ばかりである。"
 LibyaTribes.8.a: "これはいい取引のように聞こえる"
 LibyaTribes.8.b: "これは汚職だ！"
 LibyaTribes.9.t: "石油会社が部族の土地を占拠"
 LibyaTribes.9.d: "[tribal_offender]の長老たちが政府に問題を持ち込んできた。ある外国企業が操業している油田が、実は彼らの部族の所有地であるというのだ。その土地の所有権が正式に移転されたかどうかの書類は見つからない。しかし、これを口実に政府がその油田を接収することも可能だろう。ただし、そうすれば油田の利益の多くは[tribal_offender]側に流れることになる。"
 LibyaTribes.9.a: "油田を取り戻せ"
 LibyaTribes.9.b: "会社はこの油田を合法的に保有している"
 LibyaTribes.10.t: "熱烈な説教師"
 LibyaTribes.10.d: "[tribal_offender]にあるモスクのイマームが最近のフトバで、[tribal_offender]の伝統の優位性を主張し、「リビアの人々の中で、アッラーに最も忠実なのは[tribal_offender]人である」と発言した。この説教は国内の他部族の反発を招き、部族間の緊張が高まっている。"
 LibyaTribes.10.a: "彼の言う通りだ"
 LibyaTribes.10.b: "この説教師はもう説教を行えないだろう"
 LibyaTribes.11.t: "軍における虐待"
 LibyaTribes.11.d: "最近、軍内でちょっとした騒動が起きている。[tribal_offender]人将校が[tribal_defender]人新兵たちを虐待している映像がネット上で出回っているのだ。映像には、新兵たちが完全装備でコースを何時間も走り回らされたり、棒で殴られたり、押さえつけられたりする様子が映っている。この事件について尋ねられた[tribal_offender]人将校は「これらの白痴どもは兵士としての振る舞い方を知らない。棒と石で武装した古代の[tribal_offender]人戦士たちの方が、こんな犬たちよりも効果的な近代軍になるはずだ」と述べた。何人かの[tribal_defender]人長老たちは、リビア軍の名を汚したとして、この将校を軍から追い出すよう求めている。"
 LibyaTribes.11.a: "この新兵たちは何もせずに泣き言を言っている"
 LibyaTribes.11.b: "この将校は明らかに一線を越えた"
 LibyaTribes.12.t: "羊をめぐる大騒ぎ"
 LibyaTribes.12.d: "リビアの多くの部族はいまだに牧畜に従事しており、ヤギや羊、牛を土地から土地へと移動させながら育てている。最近、[tribal_offender]の牧畜民が[tribal_defender]の領土に入り込んだことで、両部族間で争いが発生した。[tribal_defender]部族は[tribal_offender]部族に対して損害賠償を要求しており、その賠償内容は主に食べられた全ての牧草を含んでいる。"
 LibyaTribes.12.a: "ただの草ではないのか？"
 LibyaTribes.12.b: "部族の領土は神聖であり尊重されるべきだ"
 LibyaTribes.13.t: "部族の襲撃"
 LibyaTribes.13.d: "昨夜、[tribal_offender]部族の者たちが、農場が自分たちの土地に建てられていると主張して[tribal_defender]の農場を襲撃した。彼らは夜のうちに農場に火を放ち、翌朝には戻ってきて住民を追い出した。[tribal_defender]の部族長老たちは、政府が介入し、[tribal_offender]襲撃者を罰することを懇願している。"
 LibyaTribes.13.a: "それは明らかに[tribal_offender]の土地だった"
 LibyaTribes.13.b: "襲撃？我々は文明社会に生きている"
 LibyaTribes.14.t: "水紛争"
 LibyaTribes.14.d: "大人工河川は多くのリビア人に無料で水を供給している。しかし、[tribal_defender]部族は、[tribal_offender]部族が大都市にある水源への[tribal_defender]のアクセスを妨害していると主張している。"
 LibyaTribes.14.a: "[tribal_defender]人にもその水を使う権利がある"
 LibyaTribes.14.b: "[tribal_defender]人は自分の土地の水を飲めばいい"
 LibyaTribes.15.t: "代表しない政治家"
 LibyaTribes.15.d: "ある小さな町で地元政府に小さなスキャンダルが発生した。この町は[tribal_defender]人が多数派であるにもかかわらず、[tribal_offender]人の政治家が町長に選出された。これに対し、町民たちは「選挙は政府が[tribal_offender]の利益を進めるために不正操作された」と非難し、代わりに[tribal_defender]人の政治家を選出するよう要求している。政府としては最近選挙を操作した記憶はないが、もしかすると地元支部が勝手にやったのかもしれない。"
 LibyaTribes.15.a: "選挙は公正だった"
 LibyaTribes.15.b: "町民の要求に応じよ"
 LibyaTribes.16.t: "石油収益の分配"
 LibyaTribes.16.d: "2つの部族が、政府が石油収益をどう分配しているかをめぐって争っている。[tribal_offender]の部族は、政府が[tribal_defender]人の生活を良くすることにばかり金を使っていると主張し、[tribal_defender]の部族は正反対の主張をしている。"
 LibyaTribes.16.a: "[tribal_offender]にもっと金を与えよ"
 LibyaTribes.16.b: "[tribal_defender]は追加の金に値する"
 LibyaFamily.1.t: "Family Casualty"
 LibyaFamily.1.d: "While military engineers were clearing up the damage from the recent British airstrike, they discovered something shocking. A badly burnt and mutilated body of one of Muammar Gaddafi's children was found among the rubble. It seems they had been inspecting the site without no one knowing, and they got caught in the attack."
 LibyaFamily.1.a: "How could this happen!?"
 LibyaFamily.2.t: "Internet Blackout"
 LibyaFamily.2.d: "Last weekend, an internet blog criticised the Gaddafi regime, specifically Muhammad Muammar Gaddafi. In response, in his role as head of the GPTC, Muhammad Gaddafi closed of the entire internet in the country for almost a week. While he was only trying to protect the regime, Muhammad's actions upset quite a lot of Libyans. Maybe someone so quick to anger should not be head of the GPTC after all?"
 LibyaFamily.2.a: "Nobody needs the internet"
 LibyaFamily.2.b: "Maybe we need a more competent replacement"
 LibyaFamily.3.t: "Fight Over Coke"
 LibyaFamily.3.d: "An adviser has disturbing news; there is a tense situation relating to Coke, and not the kind you are thinking of. Recently, Coca-Cola opened a bottling plant in Libya. Muhammad and Mutassim Gaddafi have both claimed ownership of the plant through their business ties, and this conflict has now escalated out of hand. Both Muhammad and Mutassim are now at the plant with their personal guards, armed to the teeth. There doesn't seem to be any signs of either side cooling down."
 LibyaFamily.3.a: "Intervene in favour of Muhammad"
 LibyaFamily.3.b: "Intervene in favour of Mutassim"
 LibyaFamily.3.c: "Is Pepsi okay?"
 LibyaFamily.4.t: "Muhammad Gaddafi Criticises His Father"
 LibyaFamily.4.d: "Muhammad Muammar Gaddafi has been living in exile for quite a while now. It seems that exile is weighing on him, as he recently mentioned in an interview how disappointed he is with his father. He stated that his father treats his people just like he treated Muammar; with neglect and unreasonable demands. While Muhammad holds very little influence in Libya thesedays, some Libyans have still expressed their sympathies towards him."
 LibyaFamily.4.a: "I thought he didn't care about politics?!"
 LibyaFamily.5.t: "Muhammad Rekindles His Passion For Politics"
 LibyaFamily.5.d: "After a brief discussion with his father, it seems that Muhammad has understood his position in the family. While initially reluctant to carry on his family's legacy, he has come to accept that one day he will be the leader of Libya. Gaddafi's succession is now a little bit more secure."
 LibyaFamily.5.a: "Good talk, son"
 LibyaFamily.6.t: "Muhammad Ignores His Father"
 LibyaFamily.6.d: "It seems that Muhammad is not willing to listen to his father. He does not want to follow in his father's footsteps in ruling the country, nor does he want to be like his father. After much shouting and many slammed doors, there seem to be no getting through to Muhammad. It seems for now Muammar has to be satisfied with the fact that his son is interested in at least some aspects of running the country, even if not as its leader."
 LibyaFamily.6.a: "How can I get through to him?"
 LibyaFamily.7.t: "Muhammad Leaves Libya"
 LibyaFamily.7.d: "After a heated argument about his responsibilites in ruling the country one day, Muhammad seems to have had enough of his father. Saying that he no longer feels like Libya is his home, he has decided to leave the country, at least for a little while. Hopping onto his private jet, he set course to Algeria with nobody knowing when he would be willing to return."
 LibyaFamily.7.a: "Come back home soon"
 LibyaFamily.8.t: "A Phenomenal Artshow"
 LibyaFamily.8.d: "Saif's artshow has been a success. Held in Montreal's Museum of Fine Arts in Canada, the exhibition attracted the attention of multiple international corporations and Canadian citizens. Incidentally, while attending the show, Saif was able to organise several business meetings with multiple corporate representatives from companies such as Siemens, Petro-Canada and SNC-Lavalin. They had the chance to discuss multiple investment opportunities in Libya. While a personal success for Saif, this might even be a bigger success to Libya as a whole. We have the opportunity to deepen our cooperation with one of these large corporations."
 LibyaFamily.8.a: "Siemens is known for their electronics!"
 LibyaFamily.8.b: "As an oil nation, Petro-Canada is the natural partner"
 LibyaFamily.8.c: "To develop Libya, a construction company like SNC-Lavalin is the best"
 LibyaFamily.9.t: "A Decent Artshow"
 LibyaFamily.9.d: "Saif's artshow was hosted in Montreal's Museum of Fine Arts. While the artshow managed to gather some interest, it didn't gather the attention we were aiming for. Many corporations pulled out of the sponsorship after public backlash. However, the exhibition did manage to gather the attention of the international public. At the very least, it managed to bring the attention of the world to Libyan culture, and Libya in general."
 LibyaFamily.9.a: "We can make art too"
 LibyaFamily.10.t: "An Art Disaster"
 LibyaFamily.10.d: "The artshow held in Montreal's Museum of Fine Arts has been a total disaster. Many of the corporations pulled out of the sponsorhip after public backlash, and critics have described Saif's artwork as 'lurid' and 'a triumph of banality'. Eventually, the exhibition was torn down early as the Museum faced criticism of supporting the works of an artist who was so closely tied with the political regime of Libya. This has been a total humiliation for us."
 LibyaFamily.10.a: "Lurid? Don't they know art is subjective?"
 LibyaFamily.11.t: "Saif Accepts Position As Heir"
 LibyaFamily.11.d: "While initially hesitant to walk over his older brother's birthright, Saif eventually accepted his father's suggestion to be officially made his successor. As preparation for this role, Saif has been given more power within the regime."
 LibyaFamily.11.a: "I'm proud of you, son"
 LibyaFamily.12.t: "Saif Rejects Position As Heir"
 LibyaFamily.12.d: "Despite a lengthy discussion with his father, Saif has rejected any position of successor to his father. He said that if there is to be any succession, it is the birthright of his older brother Muhammad."
 LibyaFamily.12.a: "Maybe we can talk about this again later"
 LibyaFamily.13.t: "Saif Withdraws From His Father's Inner Circle"
 LibyaFamily.13.d: "Saif didn't take his father suggestions of him being his father's successor very well. Accusing his father of nepotism, Saif said that Libya 'was not a farm to inherit'. He said he had only taken a larger role in the country's administration due to the absence of institutions, not for personaly glory. He now said that he is no longer interested in helping his father run the country."
 LibyaFamily.13.a: "You were supposed to be the chosen one!"
 LibyaFamily.14.t: "The Sunday Telegraph Loses Court Case"
 LibyaFamily.14.d: "After spending two days in court in London over a case of libel, the British judges have convicted the Sunday Telegraph of libel. The articles the newspaper had published had provided no sources for their information, and the author was unable to show any evidence behind the allegations to the court. The court ruled that the articles were clearly intended to tarnish the name of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The newspaper was sentenced to pay monetary compensation to Saif al-Islam for damages to his reputation. They have also been required by the judges to publish an additional article where they apologise to Saif al-Islam. Saif al-Islam was spotted outside the courthouse showing the V-for-victory sign. As he was leaving, he told the press the first thing he would do is call his father who is most certainly going to be happy about the results."
 LibyaFamily.14.a: "Justice!"
 LibyaFamily.15.t: "The Sunday Telegraph Accepts Settlement"
 LibyaFamily.15.d: "After spending two days in court in London over a case of libel, the Sunday Telegraph and Saif al-Islam Gaddafi have agreed to settle the dispute. With help for the arbitration by a Saudi diplomat, the Sunday Telegraph accepted to pay some of Saif al-Islam's legal costs and issue a public apology without needing to pay for damages done to Saif al-Islam's reputation. Saif al-Islam was spotted outside the courthouse showing the V-for-victory sign. As he was leaving, he told the press the first thing he would do is call his father who is most certainly going to be happy about the results."
 LibyaFamily.15.a: "A fair compromise"
 LibyaFamily.16.t: "The Sunday Telegraph Wins Court Case"
 LibyaFamily.16.d: "After spending two days in court in London over a case of libel, the British judges have found the Sunday Telegraph innocent. While the newspaper provided no evidence for their allegations in the article itself, the author provided the evidence separately when requested by the court. While the evidence isn't enough to prove a solid connection between Saif al-Islam and money laundering, there are enough links to give justification to the article being written. This result has been a big reputation hit to Saif al-Islam, who quickly hurried out of the country on the same evening as the court case ended."
 LibyaFamily.16.a: "Nonsense. They are guilty!"
 LibyaFamily.17.t: "Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Wins Award"
 LibyaFamily.17.d: "The World Economic Forum (WEF) has awarded Saif al-Islam Gaddafi with the 'Young Global Leader' award. The award is intended for leaders who are strategic and inspiring with a deep commitment to creating lasting positive change within their societies and globally. This award will definitely strengthen Saif al-Islam's position in the government."
 LibyaFamily.17.a: "Very good!"
 LibyaFamily.18.t: "Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Received PhD"
 LibyaFamily.18.d: "Gaddafi's sone Saif al-Islam has been awarded a PhD from the London School of Economics. His thesis 'The role of civil society in the democratisation of global governance institutions: from soft power to collective decision making?' was examined by multiple well respected academics. However, the thesis has collected accusation of plagiarism, as well as allegations that the thesis was ghost-written by consultants from Monitor Group, a consulting firm which has earned more than $3 million in consulting fees from Saif's father."
 LibyaFamily.18.a: "There is no plagiarism!"
 LibyaFamily.19.t: "Saif al-Islam Calls For Reform"
 LibyaFamily.19.d: "Saif al-Islam has always been the most prodigous of Gaddafi's sons. Being educated in Europe with connections to multiple politicians, he is well versed in politics and diplomacy. However, he has always been an avid reformer. It seems he has now taken his steps of reform a bit further; in a recent interview, when asked what Libya needed most, he stated 'Democracy'. When asked to clarify if he meant that Libya needed more democracy, he was recorded saying 'No. 'More democracy' would imply that we had some'. He has also criticised Libya's human rights record, and has called for more reform in context of the current Jamahiriya system."
 LibyaFamily.19.a: "Democracy? Human rights? Has he gone insane?"
 LibyaFamily.20.t: "Saif al-Islam's Charity Work"
 LibyaFamily.20.d: "In 1998, Saif al-Islam founded a non-governmental organization called the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation (GICDF). The organization is known for dealing with hostage situation with Islamic militants as well as doing charity work in Sub-Saharan Africa. A recent charity drive has greatly increased our standing with one of our African brothers."
 LibyaFamily.20.a: "素晴らしい"
 LibyaFamily.21.t: "A Hunting Accident"
 LibyaFamily.21.d: "Saif al-Islam is a frequent visitor of the United Kingdom, including the royal family there. In a recent hunting trip on the estates of Princess Anne, Saif fell off his horse and accidentally discharged his weapon into his abdomen. He was hurried to the nearest hospital but died later of his wounds. The British government has already expressed their deepest condolences to Muammar Gaddafi and the Libyan nation, and have started to make preparations to get Saif's body back to Libya. This is a terrible blow to the Gaddafi family, as Saif al-Islam was on of the more prodigious children of Gaddafi."
 LibyaFamily.21.a: "Look what they did to my boy!"
 LibyaFamily.22.t: "Al-Saadi Finds Success"
 LibyaFamily.22.d: "After a large financial contribution by the Gaddafi family, the Italian Serie A team Perugia accepted Al-Saadi into their ranks. This deal turned out to be much better than what Perugia was excpecting. With Diego Maradona as his technical consultant and Ben Johnson as his personal trainer, Al-Saadi was well prepared for his next match. While he only played 20 minutes in his first match, Al-Saadi proved a positive surprise to all. Manager of Perugia told the [ROOT.GetLeader] that they were very happy that Al-Saadi was enrolled in the team. Al-Saadi seems to be on his way to becoming a real footballer."
 LibyaFamily.22.a: "I knew he had it in him!"
 LibyaFamily.23.t: "Al-Saadi Doesn't Get Picked"
 LibyaFamily.23.d: "We haven't found any teams that would be interested in taking Al-Saadi to their ranks. We were in dicussions with the Maltese Champions League level team Birkirkara F.C., but they withdrew from the negotiations when Al-Saadi tested positive for Nandrolone in a drug test. Al-Saadi's display of his footballing skill weren't impressing anyone either, with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica stating that 'even at twice his current speed he would still be twice as slow as slow itself'. Al-Saadi probably has to keep playing in Libya for now."
 LibyaFamily.23.a: "There's always next season..."
 LibyaFamily.24.t: "Al-Saadi Gets Carried Away"
 LibyaFamily.24.d: "We managed to find a proper European team for Al-Saadi to play in but not everything has gone according to plan. With his new access to Europe, Al-Saadi has worsened his drug habit even more. He barely plays any matches and wastes his time with parties and drugs, thinking he is a massive football star. He seems to be a lost cause now."
 LibyaFamily.24.a: "That's not how you play football"
 LibyaFamily.25.t: "The Football Riot"
 LibyaFamily.25.d: "It is well known in Libyan football circles that Al-Saadi Gaddafi has matches that he plays in fixed. In a recent game with his club Al Ahly, fans of the opposing club started booing him and his team and they paraded a donkey dressed in Al Ahly's colors in the pitch with the intention of protesting Al-Saadi's meddling in the matches. Al-Saadi didn't take this to his liking, and was heard shouting 'I will destroy your club! I will turn it into an owl's nest'. As a referee intervened and tried to calm the situation, the coach of Al Ahly shoved him aside. This caused the militant fans to get violent, storming the football pitch. Eventually, this turned into a full blown riot with security forces heavily cracking down on the rioters. The rest of the season has been cancelled in fears of further riots."
 LibyaFamily.25.a: "That vain idiot!"
 LibyaFamily.26.t: "Al-Saadi Overdoses"
 LibyaFamily.26.d: "Muammar Gaddafi's son, Al-Saadi, was found yesterday dead in a hotel room in Milan, Italy. It seems that he had died of drug overdose. Known for his drug abuse and extravagant lifestyle, this doesn't exactly come as a surprise. While a 'black sheep' of the Gaddafi family, he was still very dear to his father and siblings."
 LibyaFamily.26.a: "Should've sent him to rehab"
 LibyaFamily.27.t: "Al-Saadi Quits His Addiction"
 LibyaFamily.27.d: "It was a hard week for Al-Saadi. Spending all the time in isolation seems to have been worth it and he has managed to quit his addiction to drug. However, he did pickup a pretty heavy smoking habit in the process. Luckily, cigarettes aren't nearly as deadly as cocaine. Al-Saadi apologised to his father for his past behaviour and he has promised to do a better job in the future both for the sake of Libya and his family."
 LibyaFamily.27.a: "This is the only time I like quitters"
 LibyaFamily.28.t: "Al-Saadi Relapses"
 LibyaFamily.28.d: "The first week went well in rehab, and Al-Saadi managed to stay off his drug habit. However, on his second week he relapsed heavily. He eventually left the rehab center completely. The people at the center tried to prevent this, but Al-Saadi had called his personal bodyguard to pick him up and he threatened to kill everyone at the center if he was not let go. His drug habit seems to be stuck very hard."
 LibyaFamily.28.a: "I guess this is some kind of progress?"
 LibyaFamily.29.t: "Al-Saadi Bails Libya"
 LibyaFamily.29.d: "The first week went well in rehab, and Al-Saadi managed to stay off his drug habit. However, on his second week he relapsed heavily. He eventually tried to leave the center completely. The staff at the center tried to prevent this, but Al-Saadi set his personal bodyguards on the staff. This then escalated when local police was called to the scene. Al-Saadi then in a drug fueled panic freaked out, and escaped with his bodyguards to the Tripoli Airport, where he boarded his private jet and escaped to Switzerland. He hasn't been in contact with us since, and we are not sure if he is ever coming back."
 LibyaFamily.29.a: "Well that escalated quickly"
 LibyaFamily.30.t: "Al-Saadi Shames His Family"
 LibyaFamily.30.d: "Al-Saadi has been living in exile in Switzerland for a while now, hosting extravagant parties for celebrities and friends. A recent party didn't go exactly as planned, as Al-Saadi was found passed out on a beach naked with another naked man on top of him. This news quickly spread across tabloids, with Al-Saadi's exposed body being in magazine covers across Europe. This has certainly been a big hit to the Gaddafi family name."
 LibyaFamily.30.a: "On the beach?"
 LibyaFamily.31.t: "Mutassim Gaddafi Oversteps His Boundaries"
 LibyaFamily.31.d: "It seems that Mutassim Gaddafi is still yearning to his military past. It was recently discovered that in his role as the National Security Advisor, Mutassim had requested $1.2 billion from the National Oil Corporation so he could form his own special forces brigade. This request was quickly denied and rejected by the government but Mutassim's abuse of his political position has not gone unnoticed."
 LibyaFamily.31.a: "Can he not let go of the past?"
 LibyaFamily.32.t: "Mutassim Finds A Good Deal"
 LibyaFamily.32.d: "When searching for a weapons supplier, [SOV.GetNameDef] was the clear answer. After long negotiations, Mutassim has managed to get a large batch of state of the art equipment delivered for our armed forces. This will substantially improve our army's capacity."
 LibyaFamily.32.a: "What a great businessman!"
 LibyaFamily.33.t: "Mutassim Finds An OK Deal"
 LibyaFamily.33.d: "When searching for a weapons supplier, [SOV.GetNameDef] was the clear answer. After long negotiations, Mutassim has managed to get a large batch of weapons for our armed forces. Unfortunately, it is all old stock from the Cold War that the [SOV.GetAdjective]s were planning to get rid of anyway. This won't improve our fighting capability but at least we have some extra stockpiles now."
 LibyaFamily.33.a: "Better than nothing I guess"
 LibyaFamily.34.t: "Mutassim's Deal Falls Through"
 LibyaFamily.34.d: "When searching for a weapons supplier, [SOV.GetNameDef] was the clear answer. After long negotiations, nothing of notable was gained. The [SOV.GetAdjective]s weren't willing to hand out large amount of weapons to us. The visit to [SOV.GetName] has been a waste of time, and Mutassim's role as a National Security Advisor has now been tarnished."
 LibyaFamily.34.a: "Guess we better try again some time"
 LibyaFamily.35.t: "Mutassim Gaddafi Extends Egyptian Influence"
 LibyaFamily.35.d: "Even though Mutassim Gaddafi is living in exile in Egypt, he still has connections with the Libyan regime, especially members of the General People's Committee. He has recently been in contact with many of his friends in Libya, and spoken highly of the Egyptian President [EGY.GetLeader]."
 LibyaFamily.35.a: "Is he planning a coup?"
 LibyaFamily.36.t: "Muhammad Gaddafi Leaves Libya For Good"
 LibyaFamily.36.d: "After yet another argument with his father, Muhammad Gaddafi has said that he would be leaving Libya for good. He says he no longer feels welcome at home, and just wants to live his life outside of politics. He has already prepared a trip to Algeria, though he did not say if he would make his new home there. It seems the eldest son of Gaddafi is out of the game."
 LibyaFamily.36.a: "Please don't go"
 LBA_muhammad_muammar_gaddafi_leaves_for_good_tt: "§YMuhammad Gaddafi§! is permanently exiled"
 LibyaFamily.37.t: "Mutassim Gaddafi Murdered"
 LibyaFamily.37.d: "Mutassim Gaddafi has been found murdered in a hotel room in Amsterdam. The prime suspect in the case is the Libyan arms smuggler Tarek Kaituni. It seems that Mutassim, who frequented Amsterdam on 'business trips', was in reality having an affair with Lisa van Goinga, a Dutch model and wife of Kaituni. The Dutch police are yet to apprehend Tarek Kaituni, and his current location is unknown."
 LibyaFamily.37.a: "What?!"
 LibyaFamily.38.t: "Hannibal Gaddafi Arrested"
 LibyaFamily.38.d: "Hannibal Gaddafi and his wife have been arrested in Switzerland. Two of their servants had called the police claiming that the couple had attacked them in their hotel in Geneva. Two of Gaddafi's bodyguards were also arrested in the process as they tried to prevent the police from entering the Gaddafis' hotel room. Hannibal has a history with the police in Europe. Just a few years ago, a French court fined him for hitting his girlfriend, and only a year ago two of his bodyguards were arrested when the French police tried to prevent him from speeding. Hannibal was released on a bail of 124 000 euros and his wife for 186 000 euros. This has sparked a diplomatic incident between Switzerland and Libya."
 LibyaFamily.38.a: "Switzerland isn't even a real country!"
 LibyaFamily.39.t: "Hannibal Gaddafi Drowns"
 LibyaFamily.39.d: "Due to his education and occupation, Hannibal Gaddafi frequently boards and works on various naval vessels of the General National Maritime Transport Company, the state owned trading company. An accident happened today when in stormy weather Hannibal went overboard. The crew of the ship did their best trying to save him but they were unable to pull him back up to the ship. Eventually Hannibal disappeared beneath the waves, never to be seen again."
 LibyaFamily.39.a: "They should've tried harder!"
 LibyaFamily.40.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Appointed UN Goodwill Ambassador"
 LibyaFamily.40.d: "At a a ceremony at Watassemo Charity Association headquarters in Tripoli, Aisha Gaddafi, was appointed as United Nations Development Program National Goodwill Ambassador for Libya due to her past charity work. In her new role as UN Goodwill Ambassador, she will work together with the UNDP to raise awareness on issues related to Millennium Development Goals, advocate for women's rights, work on combating the spread of HIV/AIDs and promote UNDP's work in Libya. This is a tremendous occasion as as we repair our relations with the world."
 LibyaFamily.40.a: "Good for her!"
 LibyaFamily.41.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Discovers Her Hidden Power"
 LibyaFamily.41.d: "We are not quite sure what happened with Ayesha's military training, but it has been miraculous. She just startted commanding troops and in our latest war games she even beat our top military generals. Some of our soldiers have started calling her the 'Amazon of Libya', named after the ancient warriors on Muammar Gaddafi's all-female personal bodyguard. Her military prowess has encouraged many more women to flock to recruiting centers in the hopes of becoming like her."
 LibyaFamily.41.a: "Girlpower!"
 LibyaFamily.42.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Promoted To General"
 LibyaFamily.42.d: "Ayesha has finished her training to become a general. While she hasn't been particularly talented in the training, she did have some unique ideas we might be able to utilise later. She has stated that she won't be taking an active role in the military but rather keep her rank of general as ceremonial."
 LibyaFamily.42.a: "It's something"
 LibyaFamily.43.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Fumbles Her Military Training"
 LibyaFamily.43.d: "Ayesha's military training hasn't gone exactly to plan. First she managed to get an entire brigade lost, then in a wargame she had them attacking in the wrong direction. Her stubborn personality has also caused several clashes with many senior military officials, even causing one of them to resign from the military. She eventually did make it to the rank of general. However, she won't be actively serving in the military. Despite this, the total failure of her training has caused our entire military education and army become subject to ridicule and suspicion."
 LibyaFamily.43.a: "How can you fail that bad?"
 LibyaFamily.44.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Defends Women's Rights"
 LibyaFamily.44.d: "In a recent interview, Ayesha Gaddafi publically criticised the status of women in Libya. She stated that they are oppressed in the country and not given the same opportunities as men. She especially called out [ROOT.GetLeader], pointing out to their all-female group of bodyguards. While on the surface this seems like it empowers women, in reality it simply objectifies women as the bodyguards are usually chosen by their looks and not by their military skill. This interview has caused quite a stir in Libya, and there have already been several demonstrations for women's rights."
 LibyaFamily.44.a: "Women in Libya have it just as good as the men!"
 LibyaFamily.45.t: "Ayesha Gaddafi Dies In Childbirth"
 LibyaFamily.45.d: "There are tragic news about the only daughter of Muammar Gaddafi. Last night, after her fourth child had been born, Ayesha died of postpartum bleeding. The doctors tried their best to stop the bleeding but nothing could be done. Luckily, the child was born healthy but this is still a tragic loss for the Gaddafi family."
 LibyaFamily.45.a: "The doctors should've done better!"
 LibyaFamily.46.t: "Saif al-Arab Suspected Of Acid Attack"
 LibyaFamily.46.d: "Saif al-Arab is a frequent visitor of Germany. Recently, he got into trouble at a nightclub in Munich. As his girlfriends started stripping on the dancefloor, the bouncer of the club threw him and his girlfriend out of the club. A brawl broke out between Saif and the bouncer. Later, he came under investigation by the German police of allegedly planning an acid attack against the bouncer as retaliation. Saif has obviously denied these claims."
 LibyaFamily.46.a: "The charges will obviously be dropped"
 LibyaFamily.46.b: "Send him legal help!"
 LibyaFamily.47.t: "Saif al-Arab Suspected Of Arms Smuggling"
 LibyaFamily.47.d: "The German prosecutors office is charging Saif al-Arab with arms smuggling. Apparently, they have evidence that Saif helped smuggle a bag of assault rifles, a revolver and ammunition from Munich to Paris. This is a very serious claim."
 LibyaFamily.47.a: "The charges will obviously be dropped"
 LibyaFamily.47.b: "Put some diplomatic pressure on the Germans!"
 LibyaFamily.48.t: "Saif al-Arab's Ferrari Impounded"
 LibyaFamily.48.d: "The German police has impounded Saif al-Arab's Ferrari after neighbours complained about the loud noise its exhaust was making. Saif al-Arab is now facing charges under breach of peace."
 LibyaFamily.48.a: "The charges will obviously be dropped"
 LibyaFamily.48.b: "Send him legal help!"
 LibyaFamily.49.t: "Saif al-Arab Dies In Prison"
 LibyaFamily.49.d: "While Saif al-Arab was convicted of crimes in Germany, he managed to evade a prison sentence by returning to Libya. However, for reasons unknown, he was again visiting Germany. The German police managed to capture him and he was taken to a local jail in Munich. The following day, he was found hanged in his cell. The official statement from the German police is that this was a suicide, with the most likely motivation being the shame Saif caused to his family. However, there are alternative theories of a possible revenge by fellow inmates or even a staged suicide by the German intelligence service."
 LibyaFamily.49.a: "Saif al-Arab didn't kill himself!"
 LibyaFamily.50.t: "Khamis Gaddafi Turns 18"
 LibyaFamily.50.d: "Today was the birthday of Khamis Gaddafi, Muammar Gaddafi's youngest son. He has finally turned 18 and is now ready to start taking a bigger role in the Libyan government."

 LibyaFamily.52.a: "We will avenge them!"
 LibyaFamily.53.t: "Muammar Gaddafi Humiliates The UN"
 LibyaFamily.53.d: "As Muammar Gaddafi climbed up to the speaker's podium in the General Assembly of the UN, few knew what to expect. It took him 17 minutes before he got to his main point, calling for an African seat at the Security Council. Waving a copy of the UN charter, he denounced the permanent setup of the Security Council which he said encouraged the treatment of other countries as 'second-class citizens'.\n\n'It is political feudalism for those who have a permanent seat...It should not be called the Security Council, it should be called the terror council. It did not provide us with security but with terror and sanctions,' he said as he ripped a page out of the charter in a show of defiance.\n\n'Permanent is something for God only. We are not fools to give the power of veto to great powers so they can use us and treat us as second-class citizens...Veto power should be annulled,' he added before tossing the UN charter over his shoulder. He also demanded the UN headquarters to be moved to Libya, a thorough investigation to the death of John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King, proposed that Israel and Palestine should be combined into Isratine, celebrated the Taliban, spread conspiracies about the Swine Flu and demanded 7.7 trillion dollars as reparations to Africa for colonialism. Overall, it took him full 90 minutes before ending his speech, when speeches usually last only about 15 minutes.\n\nOur great leader has shown the World that Libya is its true master!"
 LibyaFamily.53.a: "That sure showed them!"
 LibyaFamily.54.t: "Muammar Gaddafi Gets Through His Speech"
 LibyaFamily.54.d: "As Muammar Gaddafi climbed up to the speaker's podium in the General Assembly of the UN, few knew what to expect. He rambled on for a short time about how the Security Council should have a seat dedicated for Africa, while at the same time going on tangents about colonialism, Swine Flu and Israel. He seemed to be profusely sweating as he tried to get through his lines, trying to stay on topic. After 20 minutes, he was asked to stop the speech, which he did. Somewhat reluctantly Muammar Gaddafi walked down from the podium, seemingly mumbling about how this was 'another example of the West trying to silence the rise of Africa'. It definitely was a speech, but it probably didn't have the effect Gaddafi was hoping for."
 LibyaFamily.54.a: "Gaddafi needs to work on his charisma"
 LibyaFamily.55.t: "Muammar Gaddafi Kicked Off The Podium"
 LibyaFamily.55.d: "As Muammar Gaddafi climbed up to the speaker's podium in the General Assembly of the UN, few knew what to expect. He startled rambling about Zionism, calling the Security Council a terrorist organisation funded by Israel. He also mocked his fellow Arab leaders, calling them toys of the British. It wasn't long until a wave of booing began at the Assembly, with delegates calling for Gaddafi to stop his speech. Gaddafi, in response, called all the delegates idiots, and even threw a bottle of water towards the Israeli delegation. Shortly after this, the security dragged him off the podium, followed by cheers from the Assembly. As he was being dragged off, he was heard yelling 'Why are you booing me? I'm right!'. This has been a total disaster for Libya's image."
 LibyaFamily.55.a: "That did not go as planned"
 LibyaFamily.56.t: "People Understand Gaddafi's Message"
 LibyaFamily.56.d: "At noon, Gaddafi embarked on a tour of Tripoli in a long motorcade of vehicles. As he was going through neighbourhoods, he threw large quantities of money on to the streets. At the same time, loudspeakers were talking about how international charities waste money, just like he wastes money by throwing it on the street.\n\nPeople came out in droves to collect money off the streets, but oddly enough many of them refused. It seems they understood Gaddafi's message that one shouldn't rely on handouts. After the event, we have noticed an increase in the amount of overtime people spend at their work, and food banks are reporting a decrease in people. It seems that all the people needed was a little kick in the back."
 LibyaFamily.56.a: "Libyans are a hard working people"
 LibyaFamily.57.t: "People Miss Gaddafi's Point"
 LibyaFamily.57.d: "At noon, Gaddafi embarked on a tour of Tripoli in a long motorcade of vehicles. As he was going through neighbourhoods, he threw large quantities of money on to the streets. At the same time, loudspeakers were talking about how international charities waste money, just like he wastes money by throwing it on the street.\n\nPeople came out in droves to collect money off the streets, and started hoarding the money. As soon as the street was cleaned out, people continued with their daily business. The message from the loudspeakers fell on deaf ears, as people just wanted to make a quick buck. At the very least, people will be a bit happier with the regime."
 LibyaFamily.57.a: "I guess this is a good thing?"
 LibyaFamily.58.t: "People Misunderstand Gaddafi's Message"
 LibyaFamily.58.d: "At noon, Gaddafi embarked on a tour of Tripoli in a long motorcade of vehicles. As he was going through neighbourhoods, he threw large quantities of money on to the streets. At the same time, loudspeakers were talking about how international charities waste money, just like he wastes money by throwing it on the street.\n\nPeople came out in droves to collect money off the streets, and started hoarding the money. As soon as one part of the street was cleaned out, people continued following the motorcade in the hopes of more money. Ultimately thousands of people were walking behind the line of vehicles, collecting every coin they could find. Even more surprisingly, people came out even the following day, waiting for the non-existing motorcade to arrive again. A similar trend was noticed in some other Libyan cities as well. People know seem to expect that the government just hands them out money, and they have become considerably less motivated to work."
 LibyaFamily.58.a: "Didn't they understand it was an allegory? Or maybe it was a metaphor?"
 LibyaFamily.59.t: "The Car Is A Good Design"
 LibyaFamily.59.d: "After Muammar Gaddafi shared his ideas with Libyan engineers and consultants from European car manufacturers, the listeners congratulated the leader on his keen design sense. They were sure that Gaddafi's ideas could be implemented in practice succesfully. However, not all of the ideas could be used in a single vehicles. What should be the main focus? Should we make a car that is sturdy and safe, a car that is made cheaply and meant for mass production for the people or a truck that can be used for military applications when needed. And of course, we need to pick a suitable name for the vehicle."
 LibyaFamily.59.a: "The car will be as sturdy as a rock! The Rocket!"
 LibyaFamily.59.b: "We will make a quick buck with the car! The Bucket!"
 LibyaFamily.59.c: "The car will pack a bunch! The Packet!"
 LibyaFamily.60.t: "The Car Is A Flop"
 LibyaFamily.60.d: "After Muammar Gaddafi shared his ideas with Libyan engineers and consultants from European car manufacturers, the listeners were very skeptical of his idea. However, the production of the car went forward anyway. Shortly after at a car show in Libya, the Saroukh el-Jamahiriya (Libyan Rocket) was unveiled. Packed with a bunch of safety features, Gaddafi has dubbed the car the safest in the world. However, all of the safety features on the car are standard elements of any modern car. What is non-standard however, is the car's shape; both the front and rear bumpers are shaped like a wedge. The idea is that on collision, the car will simply be deflected away from anything it hits. While turning a car into a pinball might not be safest road element, this might have some military uses."
 LibyaFamily.60.a: "What the hell is that!?"
 LibyaFamily.61.t: "The Car Is A Disaster"
 LibyaFamily.61.d: "After Muammar Gaddafi shared his ideas with Libyan engineers and consultants from European car manufacturers, the listeners were very skeptical of his idea. However, the production of the car went forward anyway. Shortly after at a car show in Libya, the Saroukh el-Jamahiriya (Libyan Rocket) was unveiled. Dubbed by Gaddafi as the safest car in the world, the show continued with a live presentation of the car's unique wedge shape which would simply deflect anything the car collides with. As the car sped of on the test track, it ricocheted off the impact straight into the watching audience. As the car hit the safety barrier, it exploded in a ball of fire. Several people died due to the collision, and dozens were injured. Immediately after, there was a sudden drop in all new car sales the following week. People are refusing to buy new cars as they fear for their safety. If the safest new car is this unsafe, how bad are the others? People are even importing older cars from Cental Africa to get their hands on something old and reliable. This increase in old cars on the roads has actually worsened Libya's traffic accidents and fatalities."
 LibyaFamily.61.a: "Why would you make the car pointy!?"
 LibyaFamily.62.t: "A Successful State Visit"
 LibyaFamily.62.d: "When Muammar Gaddafi landed in [?libya_state_visit_target.GetNameDef], he brought along with with him his massive Bedouin tent, which he setup in a park in the country's capital. With him were his bodyguard, an entourage of ministers, luxury cars and a small herd of camels so he could drink their milk every morning. While originally, it was planned for Gaddafi to meet [?libya_state_visit_target.GetName]'s leader in a more official setting, eventually [?ibya_state_visit_target.GetLeader] caved in to Gaddafi's demands to have the meeting in his tent. While various business and Libya's future was discussed, nothing fruitful was achieved. However, this humiliation of a foreign head of state has increased Gaddafi's standing in the world and at home."

Eventually Gaddafi caved in an had all the meetings in a nearby luxury hotel. While various business and Libya's future was discussed, nothing fruitful was achieved.

 LibyaFamily.64.d: "When Muammar Gaddafi landed in [?libya_state_visit_target.GetNameDef], he brought along with with him his massive Bedouin tent with the intention of setting it up in a local park. The local authorities however disallowed the tent from being raised however, and Gaddafi was guided to a local hotel. Gaddafi refused to do so, demanding that it is customary to his people to hold meeting in a tent. The person he was suppose to be meeting, [?libya_state_visit_target.GetLeader], eventually cancelled all meetings as Gaddafi refused to budge his stance. This trip has been worthless and the world has seen that the 'Mad Dog' of Libya seems to be completely toothless."
 LibyaFamily.64.a: "How embarrassing"
 LibyaFamily.65.t: "A Powerful Ritual"
 LibyaFamily.65.d: "As Muammar Gaddafi had gathered some of his elite troops in a courtyard in Tripoli, a Senegalese Marabou took position in front of the troops. Writing incantations and strange symbols on a piece of paper, the paper was covered with dried lion's skin, plants that grow in cemeteries and bark from a tree where a man had died. Wrapping everything together in a neat package, the offering was put on hot red coals to slowly burn and smoke. The Libyan soldiers were ordered to walk one by one over the smoke, allowing the smoke to penetrate their vitality. Shortly after, the Marabou started invoking the spirits to give strength to the soldier. In a trance like state, the soldiers started repeating 'God...Libya...Gaddafi'. As the ritual was over, the soldiers were bloodthirsty, vigorous and ready to fight until their last breath. Libya is saved!"

The Libyan soldiers were ordered to walk one by one over the smoke, allowing the smoke to penetrate their vitality. The soldiers did as they were ordered, though most of them looked very confused. After the Marabou had invoked spirits to give strength to the soldiers, the ceremony was over. The soldiers weren't sure what to think, but at least they were happy knowing that their leader is willing to do anything to make them win."
 LibyaFamily.66.a: "Better than nothing"

Wrapping everything together in a neat package, the offering was put on hot red coals to slowly burn and smoke. The Libyan soldiers were ordered to walk one by one over the smoke. However, nobody stepped forward. The soldiers started calling the Marabou a heathen, saying that such calling upon of the Jinn was heretical and against Islam. The whole situation quickly got out of hand, with Gaddafi and the Marabou both having to escape the courtyard in panic from the wrath of the angry soldiers. Many of the soldiers dropped their uniforms and deserted right there. Word of the ritual quickly spread across the military, and our soldiers have begun losing faith in our leader left and right."
 LibyaFamily.67.a: "It was just supposed to be a magic trick!"
 LibyaFamily.68.t: "Women Excited By Lecture"
 LibyaFamily.68.d: "Gaddafi had decided to organise his lecture in Rome, while he was visiting Italy. He had sent a request to an Italian hospitality agency to invite hundreds of attractive women aged 18 to 35 (and at least 1.7 meters tall) to come to his mysterious lecture. The women were advised to not wear miniskirts or plunging necklines due to the piosity of the event. When the women were gathered in the lecture hall, Gaddafi arrived clad in all black, and begun his lecture. Gaddafi's all-female staff handed out copies of the Koran to the women, while Gaddafi himself lectured on Islam, the failure of Christianity and the role of women in the West. Gaddafi's words seemed to resonate with a lot of the women, as directly after the lecture several women alreadyd told him they'd like to convert to Islam. The event quickly attracted global media attention, and it has caused a wave of women converting to Islam and travelling to Libya to see the land where women can truly be free."

Many are calling Gaddafi's view on women oppressive and his lecture as nothing more than a thin-veiled trick to meet beautiful young women.
