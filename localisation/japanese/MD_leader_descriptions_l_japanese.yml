Previously he served as mayor of Shanghai and his continued favoring of individuals who served with him in Shanghai has led to his faction of the party being dubbed the \"Shanghai Clique\". An advocate of economic reform, his rule in the 1990s has seen a continuation of Deng Xiaoping's policy of reform and opening up and a normalizing of the private sector. He has also presided over the return of both Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese sovereign and has faced criticism over his heavy-handed approach to human rights."

 KIM_JONG_UN_LEADER_DESC: "Kim Jong-un (born January 8, 1984) was the son most valued by Kim Jong-il during his lifetime. During his days studying in Switzerland, his slightly obese frame made it possible to underestimate him. But when he did ascend to the throne, he shocked the world with his calmness, shrewdness and ruthlessness in the secret executions of his political enemies (including, according to unconfirmed reports, the execution of his paternal uncle with anti-aircraft guns), his determination to continue developing nuclear weapons despite international sanctions, and he catch precise timing of the friendly dialogue with the US and South Korea. Under his leadership as a \"great man from heaven\", perhaps there is a real possibility of North Korea becoming the \"Strong and Prosperous Nation\"?"
 KIM_JONG_NAM_LEADER_DESC: "金正男（1971年5月10日）は、金正日総書記と2番目の妻の息子である。一家の長男として、金正男は「苦難の行軍」下の人民の悲惨さを目の当たりにした。海外留学中、中国の改革開放の急速な発展を目の当たりにし、変革の力に感銘を受けた。彼は、改革だけが北朝鮮の人々に物質的繁栄と精神的幸福をもたらすことができると信じていたが、変革が自分の権力を犠牲にする可能性があることも理解していた。しかし、彼はそれを決して後悔しなかった。"
 KIM_YO_JONG_LEADER_DESC: "Kim Yo-jong (born September 26, 1987), as the only girl in her family, has shown such talent since she began her political career that Kim Jong-il exclaimed when choosing his successor: \"If only Kim Yo-jong were a boy\".

Today, her reign is proving that women can do just as well as men, no matter what kind of country's politics."
 COUNCIL_FOR_NATIONAL_PRESERVATION_DESC: "The Council, is a rump remnants of what was the federal government of the former United States. As such whatever is left is attempting to rally what people and territory it has left around a new flag. Members of the council look to create a sense of law and order as well as a sense of peace, this way they can then conduct a smooth transition of power to a new administration."
 MATHEW_CROUDER_DESC: "The \"Marshal\", or simply Mat/Mathew, is a bit of a paradox. Both talkative yet overtly quiet this young man has a sort of scatter brain approach to handling things or doing things that interest him. Despite his initial unlikeliness to become any kind of leader, his own soft power in terms of making acquaintances as well as his more gentle personality makes him a fairly relateable person. Though he has been known to be a bit of a hot head at times in more confrontational matters, he strives to do what he can for as many as he can. As he was once quoted by an interviewer, \"Life is a strange and confusing mess, you never truly know where you will end up even if you wanted to do something you may certainly find yourself doing the complete opposite. I mean from JROTC in highschool, to the odd hobby of writing a constitution and exploring the idea of a micro-nation, I never once would have even dreamed of being a political leader... Let alone one on a federal level.\" This somewhat naivety yet sort of boundless optimism has seen Mathew now put in charge of the Southern Republic of America, though what he'll do not many know, for now we just wait and see."
 CONGRESSIONAL_CHAMBERS_DESC: "With the electoral college failing and the election having...unexpected issues in the state of Florida, congress scrambles to try and figure out who to vote or at the very least get into the president's seat before things boil down any more than they already have."
 YOON_SUK_YEOL_LEADER_DESC: "Yoon Suk Yeol (born December 18, 1960) was the former prosecutor general of the Republic of Korea and the chief prosecutor of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. During his presidency, Yoon Suk Yeol declared an emergency martial law, accusing the opposition of controlling the National Assembly, sympathizing with North Korea, and paralyzing the government through anti-state activities. But then the National Assembly voted to lift the martial law. Since then, Yoon Suk Yeol has been charged with sedition and ordered to be banned from leaving the country, becoming the first incumbent president in South Korean history to be banned from leaving the country. And later Yoon Suk Yeol was arrested, becoming the first incumbent president to be arrested in South Korean history."
