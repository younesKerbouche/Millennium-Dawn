 LKT_event.1.t: "The Head Of Government"
 LKT_event.1.d: "Since We have no intention at this time of looking further north, the security of our nation's capital relies on our top four most northern states. The Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming. While some dissuade this notion as they believe the further the capital is from the front, the further away assistance and attention will be drawn. We can nevertheless not be hindered by this distractionary bickering. Many however are also wondering if we should keep to a more basic naming of the capital city or should we appeal to the native origins of the lands. For now these four candidate states are making room to look as appealing to the committee for national beginnings for their state to be chosen."
 LKT_event.1.o1: "Didn't We Just Collapse Cause Of This Kind Of Stuff?"
 LKT_event.2.t: "A Debate At Heart"
 LKT_event.2.d: "Out of our four contenders we have a split of being more in line with the old and those who want to be a bit more in tune with the native influences of the lands. In the native corner we have Montana with Fort Nakanin, a play off of the old native reservation near by that was for the Nakoda and A'ananin tribes. In North Dakota we have Sakakawea after the largest river in the state. Over in the southern participants we have Pierre South Dakota as their option, being that not much development has been seen in the state, many within the state believe that the new federal capital will be easy to create its own district to be a piece in the wider metropolitan puzzle of Pierre. Finally we have New Cheyenne, being roughly in the middle right of the state, it will take precedent over the old state capital of Wyoming which will be renamed to Old Cheyenne. Some residents are a bit hurt at the notion, however many believe its a nice symbol of renewal as the federal capital takes the torch of a new page in the young nation's history."

However we've sent auditors down there to find out the real reason these people decided to leave their already established homes to suddenly make new ones. Regardless we must wait to see what exactly is reported if we are to genuinely act."
 LKT_event.3.o1: "Can't Be That Bad, Right?"
 LKT_event.4.t: "Initial Reports"
 LKT_event.4.d: "Some information has come back and it's looking mixed at best and confusing at worst. Some reports indicate that the RF is literally as they say they are. A group of natives fleeing the Southern Republic in attempts to make a new home for themselves. As a result the Kansas economic situation has grown faster than the rest of the nation at large. However on the flip side, there are reports of some RF members engaging in criminal actions against local citizens and even some pseudo mafia like activities to keep their reputation afloat. Such back and forthing means we could have a real hand in rebuilding, or a ral knife being jabbed into our stomach. Regardless we need to make a serious choice, one which may result in actions we may come to regret down the line."

 LKT_event.5.t: "An Offer They Can't Refuse"
 LKT_event.5.d: "With the shocking reports about the RF's more illegal activities an auditor has taken the initiative and met with the leadership of the RF to more or less make them an offer. Quell back some of their grand standing and let the northern national government take more credit and we'll leave you alone. Naturally mixed reactions were met by the RF leadership and it was the loudest of them which was the growing collective response. The response was quoted as, \"We are a peaceable people and are throuoghly offended that you believe us to be common criminals and organized gangsters of sorts like your white counter parts of old. We'll show you that we will not stand for such rude and degrading remarks to stigmatize our peoples.\" The auditor was thrown out and harassed all the way to the Nebraska border, with this it is clear that our assumptions were right and we must act soon enough."

 LKT_event.5001.t: "Further Plans"
 LKT_event.5001.d: "Initial talks and investment plans has seen a growing economy all around. Such growth has made our nation see something we thought would take months and that is development. With how things are going we must look into setting up an economic commission to ensure the balanced and steady economic development of our great nation and its many peoples."
