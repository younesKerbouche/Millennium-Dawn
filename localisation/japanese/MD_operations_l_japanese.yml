 terror.18.t: "Misidentification Leads to Civilian Casualties"
 terror.18.d: "While our operatives reported the successful termination of their target, recent reports have indicated that this is not the case. A combination of incorrect intelligence and ineptitude has led to the deaths of several civilians who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. This mistake will inevitably lead to greater sympathy for the jihadist cause among the local population, but its domestic fallout could be mitigated by denying involvement."

 terror.19.d4: "Disaster has befallen our struggle, as one of our commanders has been killed by the enemy. Our brave commander reportedly killed himself rather than fall into the hands of the enemy, a commendable act that he will undoubtedly be rewarded for in the after-life."

 terror.20.d: "It has become increasingly clear that our special forces raid has failed in its objective. Many of the dead have turned out to be civilians rather than jihadist militants, and the target that the raid was supposed to eliminate was nowhere to be seen.

 raid_cache_outcome_failure: "Our operatives faced an unexpected volume of resistance from jihadist militants before reaching the arms cache, forcing our special forces to bid a hasty retreat. In the confusion, the special forces operators lost contact with the agents accompanying them."
