 MD4_election_campaign.1.d: "As the final voting draws ever closer, we have to decide who to contrast our foreign policy with. As the world becomes an increasingly tumultuous place, this issue has become particularly important to voters.\n\nSome hard-hitting negative ads will surely make our opponent's popularity tumble but there is a small chance they may successfully counter this if they have some serious dirt on us or if our attacks were based on very poor research.\n\nThe effectiveness of the attack is determined by the amount of campaign funding we received."

 MD4_election_campaign.4.d: "Despite our ferocious attacks against them, the controversial nationalists have managed to retain most of their core followers. They have scored major points across the nation, claiming that the system is broken and corrupt, that the mainstream media is manipulating society, and that [Root.GetLeader]'s policies are up for grabs to the highest bidder via campaign contributions."

 MD4_election_campaign.5.d: "Despite our best efforts, the tide of public opinion has shifted against our negative ad campaign targeting the [Root.GetNeutralParty]. There are likely several causes but one factor may be the perception that an attack from a politician of [Root.GetLeader]'s stature is an example of \"punching down\" and that the increased media coverage of our opponent's enabled them to reach out to more voters."

 MD4_election_campaign.8.d: "Ordinarily this would never even be suggested out loud - let alone considered seriously. But due to [Root.GetLeader]'s low approval rating, it might be a risk worth taking; The speaker is a fringe member of our party, known for making a number of controversial statements in the past and speaking at inopportune times. However, they are very popular among students and young people - a key group we need to convince to vote our way."

 MD4_election_campaign.10.d: "With the largest audience turnout of the campaign season, the stage was set for [Root.GetLeader] to shine. Unfortunately, the controversial co-speaker who was invited to whip up enthusiasm, proceeded to tear up the speech we had prepared, and instead went off on a long tirade about the \"failures of all administrations, including this one\" and then appealed to young people to \" vote with their heart, or stay home\" \n\nNeedless to say, this soundbite was subsequently plastered across the media - with our opponents watching on gleefully."

 coalition.22.d: "Dear [Root.GetLeader]. There comes a time, of national peril, when the military establishment must step up it's role, to fill dangerous power vacuums, safeguard the national sovereignty and our independence and patriotic values. In our view, this time for military rule - is always. However, we realize that doing so now might bring certain undesirable effects on our foreign relations. It would be... less complicated - if you just discretely do as we say.\n\nAs long as you know your place, we certainly would be a very powerful political ally for you."

 coalition.23.d: "Respected [Root.GetLeader]. Us royalists scoff at the notion that you, a commoner, could ever provide [Root.GetName] with the necessary stability and other splendid advantages that only an absolute monarch can bestow. We all know that true supreme executive power can only be properly wielded by royalty in all their holiness. It truly would be a unifying force and a powerful symbol of our greatness, as we march towards full national restoration. Clearly, absolute monarchies, blessed by divine right, outperform all other forms of government in all metrics.\n\nAlright, so we are obviously not going to crown you, so we might keep the outdated and anachronistic republican government for some time, while we royalists in the coalition search for the best candidate for the throne."
