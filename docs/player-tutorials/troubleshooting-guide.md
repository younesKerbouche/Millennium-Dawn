# Troubleshooting Guide

1. Remove the ugc_2777392649.mod file from the mod folder in ``Documents / Paradox Interactive / Hearts Of Iron IV``
2. Unsubscribe from Millennium Dawn
3. Remove the all mod files in location\steamapps\workshop\content\394360\2777392649
4. Resubscribe to Millennium Dawn
5. After this, validate the HOI4 files.
6. After finishing the validation, exit steam and then reopen steam
7. Start Millennium Dawn without any submods to ensure it boots into game as expected
  - Note: Submods can and will cause issues. Please refrain from using them where possible if you are experiencing issues.

# Save Game Corruption

Save games in Millennium Dawn are much larger than other mods. It is important to ensure you are using local game saves over cloud saves for the most stability.

# Lower End PCs

MD has a much larger footprint then other mods and sometimes this can cause issues such as random crashes or on game start slowdowns. If your PC is not the strongest we recommend at this time to play using DX9 or OpenGL to improve your gameplay experience.
