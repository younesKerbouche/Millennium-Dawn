---

### Drafting Stage
- [ ] Focus tree is layed out in software (Diagram.net e.g.), it is better to think what focuses will do while making a markup as well
  - Example: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TRd4JlJOCefTLHUeeuZ2jR4ZIQP3s2CT/view
- [ ] Detailed notes for the tree is not required but it is preferred.
  - Example: [MD Malta Content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fJkTQ5reL2Ie7ZmvlKSR7gusdK4ZPy1DepZiBVaMTzs/edit#heading=h.ygnfuf8mihof)
- [ ] Draft is approved by mentor/lead developer

**DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THIS STEP IS COMPLETED**

### Coding Section
- [ ] Focus tree layout is transferred to hoi4
  - This can be either via [Croc's Focus Tree Tool](focus-tree-tool) or via manually scripting it
- [ ] Focus tree completion rewards are set (create stubs if decisions/ideas are mentioned)
- [ ] National Ideas are created
- [ ] National Decisions are created
- [ ] Any specific mechanics are created (can be part of previous points)
- [ ] History file for the country is updated
- [ ] OOB for country is updated
- [ ] Leaders are updated if new ones are needed
- [ ] Localization is created for political parties
- [ ] Localisation for Focus tree is done
- [ ] Localisation for Ideas is done
- [ ] Localisation for decisions is done
- [ ] Unit Namelists are Created
- [ ] Influence/Investment AI is created
- [ ] Game rules for allowing player customization
- [ ] Any scripted localisation or other tooltips/scripts done

#### Graphics Section
This section is a subsection of coding. It is not imperative to do this if it is not relevant. Do not over request Graphics as they simply will not be done. Please refer to graphics-sound for this section.
- [ ] GFX is created for focuses (custom icons can be requested or made by yourself, ~15% of custom icons is considered normal and enough)
- [ ] GFX are created for ideas
- [ ] GFX is created for leaders, techs, etc.

#### Polish Stage
This section is a subsection of coding. It is is mostly for visual and quality assurance.
- [ ] Spell check your tree and localization
- [ ] Ensure the error.log is completely clear of anything relevant to your content
- [ ] Complete at least one singular playtest before presenting it to the playtesters
- [ ] Run a performance check on your content
- [ ] Draft is reported as done to lead dev and confirmed to be ready for testing
- [ ] Verify all effects match up with the standards in [MD Code Resource](code-resource)

### Playtest Phase
- [ ] Tester task is written and provided to the playtesters
- [ ] Once you have received results implement fixes/improvements to be made


### Completion Stage
- [ ] Changelog.txt and Authors.txt are updated
- [ ] Merge request is created, comments are fixed
- [ ] Other localisation teams are notified about incoming content
- [ ] Request is merged, job is done, git branch deleted and discord channel archived
