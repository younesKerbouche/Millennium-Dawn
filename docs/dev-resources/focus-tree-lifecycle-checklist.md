### Drafting Phase
<input type="checkbox"> Focus tree is layed out in software (Diagram.net e.g.), it is better to think what focuses will do while making a markup as well

- Example: [MD Spain Content](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TRd4JlJOCefTLHUeeuZ2jR4ZIQP3s2CT/view)

<input type="checkbox"> Detailed notes for the tree is not required but it is preferred.

- Example: [MD Malta Content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fJkTQ5reL2Ie7ZmvlKSR7gusdK4ZPy1DepZiBVaMTzs/edit#heading=h.ygnfuf8mihof)

<input type="checkbox"> Draft is approved by mentor/lead developer
