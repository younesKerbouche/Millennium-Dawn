# Frequently Asked Questions:

For the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://millenniumdawn.github.io/Millennium-Dawn/player-tutorials/troubleshooting-guide).

- **Why “insert country name” still doesn’t have a focus tree? I’ve been asking since dinosaurs!**
First of all – we don’t accept suggestions about focus tree for countries. Eventually, it will happen at some point of time. Remember the devs are volunteer working professionals and they are doing it for free by sacrificing time from irl activities. We appreciate the hype but determining how long it will take or how much of it is done is hard to tell.

- **I’ve found a bug, what do I do?**
Go to [⁠report-a-bug](https://discord.com/channels/210890013334831104/1121827233120661556) and inform us about it. If you report it anywhere else chances are it will be buried and forgotten.

- **Why won’t add the possibility of civilian casualties? Also why nukes don’t kill divisions?**

This goes against Paradox TOS. While sure there may be mods out there that add this kind of stuff, we are highly against it and this won’t appear in our mod at any possible period of development.

- **Why do you only have one start date? What happened to 2017?**

The team democratically decided that 2017 is less important then the 2000 start date due to the amount of content it can provide. We removed 2017 (or what was ultimately left of it) to further optimize MD so we had more disk space and file size availability for our future content and work.

- **Why won’t you add new start dates? Like 1943, 2142 and 1999**
Because or mod called “Millennium Dawn”, not “1943/2142/1999 Dawn”

- **Yeah and? Just add a new start date as “additional”.**

We won’t add any new start date at any possible period of development. Creating a new start date basically equals creating a new mod, as you must recreated all the stuff happening around the date, and it will take a ton of time and developers, as we will have to maintain it in future (once again, the reason the decided to stop support of 2017 start date)

- **When will we see new update?**

There is a dedicated channel in discord for all upcoming events. You can find all information you need there.


- **How to change country religion?**
Unless there is a focus for your country you can’t. You may do it with console commands tho.

- **How to change internal faction if it requires 2000+ pp**

You have to manually make you country less powerful, going from superpower to some lower ranks like regional power. Removing your factories, being influenced from other countries will also help you with this.

- **When will we see new update?**

There is a dedicated channel in discord for all upcoming events. You can find all information you need there.

- **Your mod looks weird for me. Nobody have “x” problem but me.**
Probably you have some submods enabled. Try setting them off. There is 99% chance some submod causes the weirdness. The list of compatible sumbods is in ⁠⁠unknown

- **How can I download the mod? I have an older version of the game?**

We host backwards compatible version of the moPd on our GitHub Releases via OneDrive downloads. You can find the versions available on the release pages.

- **Why won’t you add current events in the game?**
Because they are current events and we don’t know, nor we have divine power to know the outcome. Once we event finishes– it may or may not be added, depending on our priorities and scale of the event.

- **What can we expect in future update?**
Check ⁠⁠teasers, ⁠⁠git and ⁠⁠roadmaps for information on upcoming content.

- **I don't like the new money system, what do I do?**

If you dont want to fiddle with money too much all you can do atm is to give yourself more money! Select your country (left click on a province of yours), Open console and write "set_var treasury x" if you want to cheat with money

## Why did you ignore my suggestion/rejected the suggestion?

- It maybe against paradox TOS.
Even tho we are making the mod, paradox has the authority over it. So their rule of "no warcrimes, no violations of human rights" apply. So we cant give you a focus or a decision or whatever that lets you do horrible things, plus we don't want to do it either, even if we could. We can add it as an idea if something horrible is going on in that country and give a decision to stop doing it, if its necessary.

- It may be unnecessary or ineffective
Adding a micronation, adding moon or mars, adding parliament feature to every country are freuquent suggestions we get. A micronation isnt worth it unless its strategic like a caribbean nation or influential like vatican. Adding moon isn't practical because of how the map in the gane work also inconsequential. Adding parliament feature to every country requires a lot of work and not worth it. Your suggestions may be from this kind.

- It may be an ongoing event
Whenever something irl happens we immediately get several users suggesting we should add that. And uhm, you know, we follow the news too. We know about that irl event too, just like you. Not only suggesting it is unnecessary, the event may be unconcluded and we may not know the dynamics or the background of it, there may be unconfirmed claims or rumors about it, so we wait until its over and if there is an available and willing dev for it, it will be added.

- We may not have understood what you asked for
Sometimes users just throw ideas around just for the sake of it. They just say "High speed railroad" we ask them what they want and they just explain what that is irl. Bruh i too fucking know what a high speed railroad is, im asking how do you want to see it in the mod? Do you want us to add a nee infrastructure type which is impossible, do you want us to revise infrastructure levels which is unnecessary, do you want a decision to build more infra or something? Just elaborate, don't bombard us with random indecisive words.

- It may be one of those irredentist claims
No we are not gonna add pre-ww1 borders you fucking wehraboo. We add historical or irredentist claims only when its currently being claimed, like Syria claiming Antioch, or China claiming Taiwan; or if there is a chance of a probable new gov claiming it, like Turkey and Adjara/Batumi. Pre-ww1 germany borders are a no-no because: There are treaties forbidding it, Germany doesn't want it, both are NATO so a war is highly unlikely.

**Compare your suggestion to one of these, otherwise it's not worth it.**
